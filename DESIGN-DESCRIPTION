Introduction
============

The file, CODING-GUIDE, summarizes the languages and some best
practices that are preferred and that should be followed by
anyone wishing to COLLABORATE. It is highly recommended that
anyone extending ASGS work with the upstream project so a mutually
beneficial exchange can occur. Another benefit is that downstream
developers are able to get guidance that will make it much more
likely that their changes are accepted upstream. This means that
their work will persist and that their work to maintain their own
fork against an upstream source is eliminated.

   to several different groups ]]

Architecture Philosophy
=======================

The design decisions behind the ASGS architecture were made
to support its goals of reliability, maintainability, 
portability, simplicity, and flexibility. These decisions
are outlined below. 

0. Operation of the ASGS occurs via the ASGS Shell Environment

ASGS has evolved beyond a minimal set of scripts and
utilities to generate model guidance for decision support
for hurricane response across the US. It now generates 
a fully contained environment that comes
with its own set of programming environments, libraries (e.g.,
netCDF), and support.

1. Bash scripts are the tool of choice for workflow automation
because this is the fundamental purpose of Bash. In this role, 
the strengths of Bash are:

* ubiquity
* longevity (stability over time)
* uniformity across platforms
* execution environment management (environmental variables)
* strong process management feature set (e.g., background 
  processes, subshells, waiting for child processes) 
* direct access to input stream, pipes, utilities, and other
  classic unix userland features
* approachability

2. Perl is the tool of choice for complex data 
processing tasks that are beyond the scope of Bash. Some 
indications of this are tasks that:

a. beg for commandline flags

b. would work best if it accepted STDIN via pipe, e.g.,

   % cat input.file | thescript > output.file 2>&1

or, written another way:
   
   % thescript > output.file 2>&1 < input.file

It is crucial to note that ASGS builds its own Perl environment
and installs all of its own Perl modules, rather than using
the local Perl environment provided by the host system. This ensures
consistency across platforms and also allows us to take full 
advantage of the numerous Perl modules that are available on
CPAN. 

3. The use of languages other than Perl for complex tasks in ASGS is not 
totally disallowed, but it is discouraged. For example:

a. The python environment in ASGS is currently old (2.7) and there are no plans 
to upgrade it in the forseeable future. Perl is well suited to our goals of 
portability, maintainability, and desired longevity of code
(backward compatibility). 

b. Many of the numerically focused utilities
that post process ADCIRC and SWAN output in the ASGS are written in 
Fortran for historical reasons. However, the use of Fortran 
in ASGS is now deprecated, and new compiled utilities should be
developed in C or C++ and may be wrapped with Perl. 

c. While Matlab is capable and widely used for numerical
processing tasks, it is very difficult to deploy uniformly 
across platforms due to its propietary nature. As a result, 
tasks that require Matlab should be executed in processes
separate from ASGS itself. 

4. Compiled utilities and libraries built by ASGS

ASGS provides a variety of compiled libraries and utilities, e.g.,
netCDF and HDF5 which are required for ADCIRC and related utilities.
This is done so that a consistent environment can be provided across
a variety of machines - rather than relying on many of these machines
supporting what we need. This requires a large amount of time by
ASGS developers, operators, and sysadmins of the many different
systems that are used.

Integrating utilities and libraries that require compiling work
best when they are provided "upstream" in a traditional archive
(e.g., "tar.gz" or "zip") and are distributed with a "configure"
file and a Makefile. It's important to note that source code for
upstream libraries and utilities (e.g., gnuplot, ImageMagick) are
not contained in the ASGS git repository; but ASGS does support
building them.

In addition to this, there are utilities written in Fortran that
are distributed as source code and an associated Makefile.

When ASGS "supports" something that is compiled, this means
generally that:

* there's a separate script that does the download, configure, make,
  make install
* the final location of the libraries (and header files) are properly
  recorded in the "ASGS Shell Environment" via environmental
  variables, LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LD_INCLUDE_PATH; this is to support
  the compiling of other programs that require them (e.g., ADCIRC)
* the final locations of the binary executables are recorded via PATH

Adding support for a new compiled tool or library is relatively
straightforward.  What's not straightforward is the best way to add
new custom utilities in compiled languages. But it can be done
pretty easily if it follows the form of what exists now. This means:

* separate directory for the library or utility
* knowledge of the final location of the libraries or executable binaries
* Makefile, and if needed, a "configure" script

Supported languages are the basics: C, Fortran (for existing utilities), 
C++ - but this is entirely dependent on the compiler suites available. ASGS only
properly supports two suites, GCC (includes gfortran) and Intel.
