#

# This script uses the template fort.15 file and the ATCF formatted fort.22
# file as input and produces a fort.15 file as output. The name of the template
# file and the fort.22 file to be used as input must be specified on the
# command line. 
#
# It optionally accepts the csdate (YYYYMMDDHH24), that is, the 
# calendar time that corresponds to t=0 in simulation time. If it is 
# not provided, the first line in the fort.22 file is used as the cold start 
# time, and this time is written to stdout.
#
# It optionally accepts the time in a hotstart file in seconds since cold
# start.
#
# If the time of a hotstart file has been supplied, the fort.15 file 
# will be set to hotstart.
#
# It optionally accepts the end time (YYYYMMDDHH24) at which the simulation
# should stop (e.g., if it has gone too far inland to continue to be 
# of interest).
#
# If the --name option is set to nowcast, the RNDAY will be calculated such 
# that the run will end at the nowcast time.
#
# The --dt option can be used to specify the time step size if it is 
# different from the default of 3.0 seconds. 
#
# The --bladj option can be used to specify the Boundary Layer Adjustment
# parameter for the Holland model (not used by the asymmetric wind vortex
# model, NWS=9.
#
# The NHSINC will be calculated such that a hotstart file is always generated
# on the last time step of the run.
#
# usage:
#   %perl control_file_gen.pl [--cst csdate] [--hst hstime]
#   [--dt timestep] [--nowcast] [--controltemplate templatefile] < storm1_fort.22
