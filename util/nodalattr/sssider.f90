       PROGRAM sssider

!Program to identify nodes that should be set as dry for the nodal 
!attribute file.  Assumes nodes and elements in mesh file are ordered 
!in ascending order from 1.  This program has to guess at the largest 
!number of nodes connected to any other node, if a guess isn't 
!provided as an input.  If this value is too small, an error will 
!occur.

!First, find the node nearest each seed location.  No conversion is 
!done from latitude/longitude to a uniform measure of distance, so 
!this is somewhat approximate.  This node, if wet, is considered the 
!seed node.  For each seed node, the algorithm marches outward, 
!finding every node connected to the seed node that should be 
!considered wet, then every node connected to those wet ones that 
!should be wet, and so on until no new wet nodes are discovered.  
!Once all connected nodes that should be classified as wet have been 
!found, the search is complete.  The remaining nodes that should be 
!classified as wet, but that are not connected back to one of the seed 
!nodes are therefore the isolated nodes that must be set to start as
