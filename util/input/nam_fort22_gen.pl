#
# Creates an ADCIRC fort.22 for the OWI format (NWS12) by determining 
# the number of blank snaps to insert before the actual meteorological
# data begins. The number of blank snaps is based on the difference
# between the cold start time and the beginning of the wind data, and
# on the increment in the wind data.
