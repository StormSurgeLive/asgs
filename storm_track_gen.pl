#
# This script accepts raw ATCF files from the NHC and produces various
# fort.22 files for ADCIRC vortex models. It accepts a forecast file 
# format and optionally a hindcast file. It also requires the cold start
# time. By default, it produces a fort.22 file for one of the ADCIRC 
# vortex wind models that represents the NHC consensus forecast. 
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ASSUMPTIONS:
#
# 1. The ADCIRC coldstart time (or the sum of the coldstart time and the number
# of seconds from the hotstart file in the case of a hotstart) must correspond
# exactly to one of the times in the hindcast or forecast file.
#
# 2. Conversion of km to degrees (lat and lon) is only approximate and 
# could be made more accurate.
#
# 3. The fill-in of the forecast central pressure is based on an algorithm
# under development by Jason Fleming (jason.fleming@seahorsecoastal.com). This
# algorithm is the subject of current research and is subject to change.
#
# 4. The code was designed for a real time context, so it assumes that 
# it wouldn't make sense to apply a perturbation to a nowcast or hindcast, 
# only to a forecast. So therefore forecast data are required.
#
# 5. Also the forecast is being hotstarted from the end of a previous nowcast, 
# so the forecast track file needs to pick up where the previous nowcast
# track file left off. The ADCIRC vortex met models need to start with the 
# track data that correspond to the hotstart time, so at least the first
# line in the forecast track file has to be the same as the last line in 
# the previous nowcast track file, i.e., it has to come from BEST track data.
# The requirements for both hindcast and forecast data could be relaxed in 
# storm_track_gen.pl to make it more of a generalized ensemble-generating 
# tool outside the context of real time guidance.
