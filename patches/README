Patch sets are broken down by:

- program (e.g., ImageMagick-7, ADCIRC)
- if necessary, there should one additional directory hierarchy that
  is a combined "patchset", i.e., all patches that can be applied and have
  been grouped so there are no conflicts
- "patchset" directories may very well contain an intersection of patches,
  but should not be totally identical; this means that some patches will
  be duplicated in different patchsets
