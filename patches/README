Patch sets are broken down by:

- program (e.g., ImageMagick-7, ADCIRC)
- if necessary, there should one additional directory hierarchy that
  is a combined "patchset", i.e., all patches that can be applied and have
  been grouped so there are no conflicts
- "patchset" directories may very well contain an intersection of patches,
  but should not be totally identical; this means that some patches will
  be duplicated in different patchsets

Adding ADCIRC patch sets is dynamically based on the contents
of the patches/ADCIRC director. To add an officially supported
patch set, do the following:

1. create a directory in patches/ADCIRC that reflects the name
you wish to preset in the "build adcirc" menu,

  mkdir patches/ADCIRC/v53release-my-precious

2. copy 2 files from any existing supported version in patches/ADCIRC:

  cp patches/ADCIRC/v53release/info.sh patches/ADCIRC/v53release-my-precious/info.sh
  cp patches/ADCIRC/v53release/about.txt patches/ADCIRC/v53release-my-precious/about.txt

3. edit these 2 new files:

  a. patches/ADCIRC/v53release-my-precious/about.txt <- contains a short description text for the menu

  b. patches/ADCIRC/v53release-my-precious/info.sh   <- contains 2 key variables that need to be defined

# example info.sh
export ADCIRC_GIT_BRANCH=v53release # this is the base git branch, tag or SHA
export SWANDIR=swan                 # defines where SWAN is located (changed in v55+)

4. adding patches

Doing this will be the subject of another future document, but in the example
above, it is sufficient to copy all of the *.patch files from patches/ADCIRC/v53release:

  cp patches/ADCIRC/v53release/*.patch patches/ADCIRC/v53release-my-precious/

Nothing else is required to support patches, they will be applied auto matically
if they are in the directory and the info.sh is set up proper; since the info.sh
defines the starting point of the code onto which the patch files are applied.
And this is why defining ADCIRC_GIT_BRANCH is extremely important.

Please report issues or bugs to the ASGS Github bug tracker.
