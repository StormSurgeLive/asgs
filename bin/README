This is directory is for officially supported and distributed
tools only. For custom or "work in progress" tools, please see
the my-bin/README for more information.

The idea is that contributed tools be made available for my-bin/,
then eventually promoted into bin/ once it's been fully vetted
and deemed generally useful.
