This document describes the development workflow and expectations from
anyone contributing to the code base. The basics are covered here, but
will be expanded as time and need permit.

NOTE 1: Do not hesitate to ask for help. ASGS developers are friendly and always
willing to assist those wishing to contribute in some way - creating issues for
bugs, contributing code, documentation, etc.

NOTE 2: The best way to learn git is: practice, practice, practice! It is a skill
that's developed over a long time and by working through many different situations
and collaborating with many individuals using many types of workflows. So be
be patient, it's something that comes with time. But once the learning curve is
climbed, git is an incredibly flexible and powerful tool for development inside and
among teams.

The general workflow is:

A. create an "issue" (not required until the pull request (PR) is created). [1,2]
B. create a branch on your "local" checkout of YOUR remote (See Appendix A below).

    git checkout master
    git pull upstream master # make sure branch point is up to date
    git checkout -b my-branch-name

C. make changes...now ready for a PR,

Note: your branch may contain any number of commits, but it is preferred to have
one squashed commit and a meaningful commit message that references the issue
associated with the change. It is often the case that some commits should remain
isolated, if in doubt please ask. See Appendix B for more information on that.

D. make sure your branch is pushed to your remote,
  
     git push origin my-branch-name

E. Make and commit changes to the code

F. Create a pull request

If you are ready to create a PR, the output of the "git push" above will
provide a URL. Visit this URL to complete the PR.

There, you will specify:

* target branch (typically master)
* source branch (typically the branch you just pushed)
* a reviewer - add someone from the team to review your work

G. Now you wait for the reviewer to look at it, upon a passing review, they
will follow the merge process that is in place. If there are changes that
must be made before merge, every situation can be unique, then work with
the reviewer or ask questions about how to use git. In general, "fixes"
needing to be made before the actual merge should be using the "--fixup"
flag when making commiting the fix to any that needs to be done. 

Appendix A - Setting up your own remote repository

1. create your own "remote" fork via the Github web interface, this is visible
when viewing the main "upstream" repo.

To begin, anyone developing  should clone the repository in their own
github space (they have good documentation, please refer to it).

2. git clone your own remote, not the main one; this will set up your
remote locally as "origin"

  git clone git@github.com:<your-gh-user>/asgs.git
  cd asgs

3. add the main repo as the "upstream" remote

  git remote add upstream git@github.com:StormSurgeLive/asgs.git 

Now verify the remotes are set up properly:
  
  git remote -v
  origin          git@github.com:<your-gh-user>/asgs.git (fetch)
  origin          git@github.com:<your-gh-user>/asgs.git (push)
  upstream        git@github.com:StormSurgeLive/asgs.git (fetch)
  upstream        git@github.com:StormSurgeLive/asgs.git (push)

From here on out, "origin" will refer to YOUR remote repository
and "upstream" will refer to the canonical one, "StormSurgeLive/asgs.git".

Appendix B - Commit messages and squashing commits for pull requests

0. Use one of Github's idioms in the text of the commit message for
linking the PR/commit(s) to a formal issue; e.g.:

```
  Commit "subjected"

  Issue <issue-number>: helpful description of change, reason for change,
  design decisions, etc.

  Resolves #<issue-number>. 
```

Note: blank lines are important to the format.

1. make your commit messages informative and properly formatted

For information on how to write good commit messages, see

  https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

Do NOT look at the repository log, chances are there are more non-ideal
commit messages in there than good ones.

2. Add the issue number and any related issue numbers to the commit
message. If github sees a "#" in front of a number, it will attempt to link
it to an issue or pull request from the same upstream repo (or its own).-
