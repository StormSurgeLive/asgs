Quick Start:

Run,

./init-asgs.sh

Notes:

./init-asgs.sh is a wrapper script around ./cloud/general/asgs-brew.pl
that guides a user through a few questions. It concludes by asking the
user if they wish to run asgs-brew.pl. If the user selects "y", then
./cloud/general/asgs-brew.pl is executed using the required flags with
the designated values.

asgs-brew.pl will build all required untilities, install perl locally
using perlbrew, install python 2.7.17 locally, then provide a shell
wrapper to the ASGS environment via the asgsh shell.

Once asgs-brew.pl is completed successfully, it will output the simple
instructions used to run asgsh for the first time.
