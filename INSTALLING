Quick Start (interactive):

Run,

./init-asgs.sh

General Notes:

0. It is recommended that ASGS be cloned (from Github) and installed in
your $WORK directory. The asgs directory has the potential to grow quite
large due to the way it currently handles downloaded needed input files
like ADCIRC meshes and other input files. An attempt to have all interactive
installation tools prefer the $WORK directory has been made (including
'build adcirc', which is a guided installation of ADCIRC).

1. ./init-asgs.sh is a wrapper script around ./cloud/general/asgs-brew.pl
that guides a user through a few questions. It concludes by asking the
user if they wish to run asgs-brew.pl. If the user selects "y", then
./cloud/general/asgs-brew.pl is executed using the required flags with
the designated values.

2. asgs-brew.pl will build all required untilities, install perl locally
using perlbrew, then provide a shell, wrapper to the ASGS environment via
the asgsh shell.

Once asgs-brew.pl is completed successfully, it will output the simple
instructions used to run asgsh for the first time.

Platform Specific Notes:

I. Hatteras

New accounts on Hatteras are provided with a fairly vanilla environment,
with all of the interesting applications and compilers provided via the
'module' command. For ASGS, this means that one must ensure that the Intel
Compiler and MPI libraries are loaded before attempting an installation.
For example, either via commandline or provided for via $HOME/.bash_profile
the following modules should be loaded:

	module load intelc/18.0.0
	module load openmpi/intel_3.0.0

II. SuperMIC (LSU/HPC) and QueenBee2 (LONI):

The ASGS installation process may take more time and computational resources
than the LSU resources allow. For this reason, it is recommended that ASGS
be build in a single node interactive session; e.g.,

1. launch an interactive session on a compute node:

        # on SuperMIC
	qsub -I -l walltime=02:00:00,nodes=1:ppn=20 -A your-allocation-name 

2. once the session launches, follow the instructions for installing ASGS
