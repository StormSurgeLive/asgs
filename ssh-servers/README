To add an entry, copy an existing file using the
short name that is to be used by the ASGS config
script, then edit the file so that parameters are
correct.

Example,

cp ./tacc_tds.sh ./my_new_tds.sh
vim ./my_new_tds.sh

NOTE: this directory is for "officially" supported
THREDDS servers. ASGS currently doesn't yet suport
local THREDDS server, but this can be changed when
someone actually needs to use it.

Another thing to note is that these "THREDDS" servers
are treated simply as remote machines and files are
sent over ssh/scp; but the vestigial names that
indicated "OPENDAP" remain. General remote servers
can be added here, too.
