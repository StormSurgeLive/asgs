I. Automated Building and "Installing" of ASGS

There is a script that is going to support a single command to build the required
environment for ASGS on all platforms.

        cd $HOME
        https://github.com/jasonfleming/asgs.git
	cd ./asgs
	perl ./cloud/general/asgs-brew.pl --compiler=intel --machinename=<name-used-in-makefiles> --install-path=$HOME/opt

*Note: the "perl" used to run asgs-brew.pl can be the system perl. The script doesn't
use any modules that are not part of the perl core set.

When this command is issued (be sure to use the machine's "name" as it is in the
various makefiles), it runs through a series of steps that go through and build
required libraries (e.g., HDF/NetCDF, OpenMPI - if gfortran is specified as the
compiler, etc). It also builds internal Fortran based tools spread throughout the
asgs directory. The script also build the expected Perl environment using the
"perlbrew" tool.

What the script does not do:

a. it doesn't attempt to build any of ADCIRC or SWAN, but it does set up the environment
needed to do so

b. it doesn't do anything for the set up of an ASGS ADCIRC model run

II. Getting More Information

The script itself contains quite a bit of documentation. It's written in Perl,
so the "perldoc" command can be used to render the internal documentatin that is
contained inside of the script.

	perldoc ./cloud/general/asgs-brew.pl

III. What To Do After asgs-brew.pl Is Run

After asgs-brew.pl runs, it will output the environmental variables as the were
set during the execution of the script. This is useful because it accumulates the
various environmental variables and their values as each step is run to completion.

Copy this output and add it to the $HOME/.bash_profile file. To load the new
values for the envronment, use the following command:

        source $HOME/.bash_profile

Assuming asgs-brew.pl ran to completion, adding the environmental variables and
source'ing .bash_profile will:

a. ensure that the perl being used is the one added by asgs-brew.pl (via perlbrew)
this can be done with the following command:

        which perl

The result should point to the perlbrew bin directory. Now once the environment
is set up properly, it should be the expected manual process to build ADCIRC. 
There is a file that is being create to add the building of ADCIRC to asgs-brew.pl.
Below are the manual steps:

1. Checkout the adcirc-cg repo on Github; it is restricted so you need to have access
and github does make you send your credentials.

2. Issue the expected make command, something like: 

        make all NETCDF=enable NETCDF4=enable NETCDF4_COMPRESSION=enable MACHINENAME=lonestar compiler=intel

There is a script that is being prepared as part of the asgs-brew.pl, but it's not
ready yet. 

        ./cloud/general/init-adcirc.sh

Right now it's best used as an example. Again, the user checking ADCIRC fromg the
Github repository needs to use their Github credentials on the commandline.
