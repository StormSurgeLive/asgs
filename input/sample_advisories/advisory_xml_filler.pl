# Parses historical text forecast/advisories from html files downloaded 
# from the National Hurricane Center and creates an xml file (using
# a template) to simulate the xml files generated in real time 
# for new forecast/advisories from the NHC. These can then be used
# in the ASGS to drive ADCIRC with the forecast/advisories for that
# storm.
#
# If the name of a best track file is optionally provided, this script 
# uses it to create a truncated best track file to accompany 
# the xml forecast/advisory file.  
#
#----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Data needed from the forecast advisories to fill the XML template:
#
# %stormClass%
# %stormNameAllCaps%
# %advisoryNumber%
# %dateTimeIssued%
# %forecastAdvisoryText%
#
# %fileName% (either formed by this script or fed as an input param)

# Sample shell script using this file:
