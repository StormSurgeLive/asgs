POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE CLAUDETTE DISCUSSION NUMBER   7
NWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL       AL032015
1100 PM AST TUE JUL 14 2015

Claudette has lacked organized deep convection for nearly 10 hours
now, and it only consists of a swirl of low-level clouds.  The
cyclone is currently over SSTs near 17 C, so it is highly unlikely
that significant thunderstorm activity will return.  Therefore,
Claudette is considered a post-tropical cyclone, and this is the
last advisory on this system issued by the National Hurricane
Center.

The post-tropical cyclone is moving quickly northeastward at
about 18 kt, and this general motion is expected to continue until
the cyclone dissipates on Wednesday.  The current wind speed is
estimated to be 40 kt based on recent ASCAT data.  Environment
Canada's buoy 44141 has been helpful in locating the center and
estimating the minimum pressure.

Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and available on the Web
at http://www.opc.ncep.noaa.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.shtml.
