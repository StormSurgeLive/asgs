Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Thu Sep 17 2020<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on <br/>
recently downgraded Tropical Depression Sally, located inland <br/>
over southeastern Alabama, on Hurricane Teddy, located over the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic, and on Tropical Storm Vicky, located over <br/>
the eastern tropical Atlantic. <br/>
<br/>
Thunderstorm activity associated with a low pressure system located <br/>
over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico has increased in coverage and <br/>
organization this morning. In addition, recent satellite-derived <br/>
surface wind data indicate that the low has become better defined. <br/>
Upper-level winds are expected to gradually become more conducive <br/>
for development, and a tropical depression is likely to form during <br/>
the next day or so while the low meanders over the southwestern Gulf <br/>
of Mexico. An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled <br/>
to investigate the disturbance later today, if necessary.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
An elongated area of low pressure located a few hundred miles <br/>
south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands is producing disorganized <br/>
shower and thunderstorm activity.  Environmental conditions are <br/>
expected to be conducive for development during the next few days, <br/>
and a tropical depression could form before upper-level winds become <br/>
less favorable over the weekend.  The low is forecast to move <br/>
west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph during the next several days.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A non-tropical area of low pressure is located over the far <br/>
northeastern Atlantic Ocean a few hundred miles east-northeast of <br/>
the Azores.  This system is forecast to move east-southeastward and <br/>
then northeastward at about 10 mph over the next day or two, and its <br/>
chances of acquiring some subtropical characteristics before it <br/>
reaches the coast of Portugal late Friday appear to be decreasing.  <br/>
For more information on this system, see High Seas Forecasts issued <br/>
by Meteo France. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Tropical Storm Vicky Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL212020
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 16 2020
 
A layer of cirrus clouds are covering the center of Vicky, but those 
clouds are associated with outflow from Hurricane Teddy.  A 
combination of outflow from Teddy and an upper-level low to the 
north of Vicky is causing very strong westerly winds across the top 
of the struggling tropical storm. As a result, Vicky is producing 
minimal convection that is displaced to the east of the center. 
Recent ASCAT data indicated that the maximum winds are still near 
35 kt, but Vicky's wind field is becoming smaller and the system is 
on the overall decline. There is no indication that the shear will 
decrease and Vicky should weaken as a result. The NHC forecast calls 
for Vicky to become a remnant low within 24 hours (if not sooner) 
and dissipate in a few days.

Vicky is still heading generally westward. The tropical storm will 
likely continue westward through tomorrow morning, and then turn 
west-southwestward in the low-level tradewind flow after that for as 
long as it lasts. There is little spread in the track guidance and 
the NHC forecast is essentially the same as the multi-model 
consensus.

----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Sally
was located near latitude 31.8 North, longitude 85.7 West. The
depression is moving toward the northeast near 12 mph (19 km/h), and
a northeastward to east-northeastward motion is expected into 
Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Sally will move 
across southeastern Alabama this morning, over central Georgia 
this afternoon and evening, and move over South Carolina late 
tonight into Friday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 30 mph (45 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast during the
next couple of days, and Sally is expected to become a remnant low
by tonight or Friday morning.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on nearby surface 
observations is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sally can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC,
and on the web at <a href="http://www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml">www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT4.shtml</a>
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals expected as Sally moves across the 
Southeast U.S. through Friday:

Central Georgia: Sally will produce additional rainfall totals of 3 
to 6 inches, with localized higher amounts, on top of 3 to 6 inches 
which has already fallen.  Widespread flash flooding and minor to 
moderate river flooding is likely. 

Central to upstate South Carolina: 3 to 6 inches, with isolated 
amounts of 10 inches. Widespread flash flooding and minor to 
moderate river flooding is likely. 

Western to central North Carolina into south-central and southeast 
Virginia: 4 to 6 inches, isolated amounts up to 8 inches. Flash 
flooding and widespread minor river flooding is likely.
 
STORM SURGE:  Water levels will continue to recede through the day
today.
 
TORNADOES:  A couple of tornadoes may occur early this morning
across southern Georgia and northern Florida.  The threat of
tornadoes will shift northeastward into eastern Georgia and much of
the Carolinas today and tonight.
 
SURF:  Swells from Sally will continue to affect the Gulf Coast
from the Florida Big Bend westward to southeastern Louisiana
through today. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.

Tropical Depression Sally Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192020
400 AM CDT Thu Sep 17 2020
 
Although the overall convective cloud and rain shield in satellite 
and radar imagery continues to erode, Tropical Depression Sally is 
still producing significant rainfall across east-central Alabama 
and west-central and central Georgia.  Surface observations 
and Doppler radar data indicate that Sally has weakened to a 25-kt 
depression over southeastern Alabama.  Sally will continue to 
weaken, and fairly rapidly at that, due to increasing friction and 
loss of convection owing to very hostile westerly to southwesterly 
vertical wind shear in excess of 40 kt. Sally will likely 
degenerate into a remnant low pressure system by tonight or early 
Friday, and merge with a frontal system over North Carolina by 
Friday evening.
 
Sally is moving northeastward or 055/10 kt. A northeastward to 
east-northeastward motion will continue for the next 36 hours or 
so as the cyclone moves ahead of a broad deep-layer trough over the 
northeastern United States.  The official track forecast is down
the middle of the tightly packed NHC model guidance suite, and lies 
close to the previous advisory track and the consensus model HCCA.

This is the last NHC advisory on Sally.  Future information on this 
system, including the rainfall threat, can be found in Public 
Advisories issued by the Weather Prediction Center beginning at 
10 AM CDT, under AWIPS header TCPAT3, WMO header WTNT34 KWNH, and 
on the web at http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov 
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Widespread flooding is expected from central Georgia through 
southeastern Virginia.  Along the central Gulf Coast, most 
widespread moderate to major river flooding from the historic 
rainfall event will crest by the weekend, but rivers will remain 
elevated well into next week.

...TEDDY FORECAST TO STRENGTHEN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.8N 51.5W
ABOUT 670 MI...1075 KM ENE OF THE LESSER ANTILLES
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...90 MPH...150 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...976 MB...28.82 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Teddy was located
near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 51.5 West.  Teddy is moving
toward the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this general motion 
is expected to continue through the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 90 mph (150 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, 
and Teddy could become a major hurricane Thursday night or Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 255 miles
(405 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 976 mb (28.82 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Large swells generated by Teddy are reaching the Lesser
Antilles and the northeastern coast of South America and should
spread westward to the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and
the east coast of the United States by the weekend.  These
swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Teddy Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202020
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 16 2020
 
Teddy has been a perplexing hurricane thus far.  The infrared 
satellite presentation appears rather impressive, with the center 
embedded beneath a Central Dense Overcast with cloud tops as cold 
as -85 degrees Celsius.  Despite the presentation, however, Dvorak 
estimates from TAFB and SAB are a consensus T4.5/77 kt, and 
objective estimates range between 70-75 kt.  Teddy's initial 
intensity is therefore set just above these estimates at 80 kt.

A recent ASCAT pass indicated that Teddy's center is a little 
farther to the southwest than previously estimated.  However, the 
long-term motion remains toward the northwest (315/11 kt).  The 
track forecast remains straightforward the the next 3 days, with 
the guidance in good agreement that a mid-tropospheric high over 
the central Atlantic will drive the hurricane northwestward toward 
the western Atlantic.  There is a little more spread among the 
track models on days 4 and 5, related to timing differences on 
exactly where and how fast Teddy begins to recurve ahead of an 
approaching mid-latitude trough coming from the northeastern United 
States.  The new NHC track forecast has been nudged westward during 
the first 3 days to account for the initial position adjustment, 
but otherwise it's still close to the previous prediction even with 
the increasing model spread on days 4 and 5.

An upper-level trough situated to the northwest of Teddy is causing 
about 10-15 kt of deep-layer southwesterly shear over the 
hurricane, and some model analyses suggest that there could be 
stronger shear in a layer below the level of the upper-level 
outflow.  The deep-layer shear is expected to increase a bit during 
the next day or so, but this should be offset by a favorable 
thermodynamic environment, allowing for some intensification during 
that time.  The shear might relax by days 3 and 4, but then the 
thermodynamic environment becomes a little less conducive for 
strengthening.  In particular, Teddy may move over the cold wake 
of Hurricane Paulette, and the SHIPS guidance indicates that 
relatively warm upper-level temperatures could be a negative 
factor.  All that said, the NHC intensity forecast lies near the 
top end of the guidance envelope, showing Teddy peaking in 
intensity in a couple of days and then only gradually weakening 
through the end of the forecast period.
