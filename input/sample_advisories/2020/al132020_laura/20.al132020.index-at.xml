DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM EDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Laura was
located near latitude 21.7 North, longitude 82.2 West. Laura is
moving toward the west-northwest near 20 mph (31 km/h), and this
general motion with some decrease in forward speed is expected over
the next day or so.  A turn toward the northwest is forecast by
Wednesday, and a northwestward to north-northwestward motion should
continue through Wednesday night.  On the forecast track, the center
of Laura will cross western Cuba this evening and move into the 
southeastern Gulf of Mexico overnight.  Laura is then forecast to 
move over the central and northwestern Gulf of Mexico Tuesday night 
and Wednesday, and approach the northwestern coast of the Gulf of 
Mexico Wednesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is expected when the storm moves over the Gulf of 
Mexico, and Laura is foreast to become a hurricane by late Tuesday. 
Additional strengthening is forecast on Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km) 
primarily to the northeast and east of the center. 
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Laura can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.

STORM SURGE:  The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the
tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by
rising waters moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could
reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated
areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

High Island TX to Morgan City LA including Sabine Lake, Calcasieu 
Lake, and Vermilion Bay...7-11 ft 
Port Bolivar TX to High Island TX...4-6 ft 
Morgan City LA to Mouth of the Mississippi River...4-6 ft 
Mouth of the Mississippi River to Ocean Springs MS including Lake 
Borgne...3-5 ft 
San Luis Pass TX to Port Bolivar TX...2-4 ft
Galveston Bay...2-4 ft
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas...2-4 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related
flooding depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal
cycle, and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
RAINFALL: Laura is expected to produce the following storm total 
rainfall accumulations into tonight:

Western Jamaica, Western Cuba and the Cayman Islands: 4 to 6 inches, 
with maximum amounts of 10 inches. Across the Greater Antilles this 
heavy rainfall could lead to life-threatening flash and urban 
flooding, and the potential for mudslides. 

From Wednesday afternoon into Saturday, Laura is expected to produce 
rainfall of 4 to 8 inches, with isolated maximum amounts of 12 
inches across portions of the west-central U.S. Gulf Coast near the 
Texas and Louisiana border north into portions of the lower 
Mississippi Valley.  This rainfall could cause widespread flash and 
urban flooding, small streams to overflow their banks, and minor to 
isolated moderate river flooding.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to spread westward
within the warning area in western Cuba through this evening.
Tropical storm conditions are also expected within the warning area
in the middle and lower Florida Keys and the Dry Tortugas tonight.

Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area along 
the Gulf Coast by late Wednesday, with tropical storm conditions 
possible by Wednesday afternoon. 

SURF:  Swells generated by Laura are affecting portions of Cuba, the
central Bahamas, and the Florida Keys. Swells are expected to
spread northward along portions of the west coast of Florida
peninsula and the coast of the Florida panhandle on Tuesday
and Tuesday night, and reach the northern and northwest Gulf coast
by Wednesday. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf
and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  An isolated tornado is possible through tonight across 
the Florida Keys.

Tropical Storm Laura Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL132020
500 PM EDT Mon Aug 24 2020
 
The satellite presentation of the tropical storm has improved 
somewhat with deep convection remaining over the center, and an 
increase in banding over the southeastern portion of the 
circulation. Earlier aircraft and scatterometer data, however, 
indicated that there has been little change in strength today, and 
the initial intensity remains 50 kt.  These observations have shown 
the the stronger winds are located in the convective band well east 
and southeast of the center, and that the system currently lacks  
an inner core. This is likely the reason that Laura has not been 
able to strengthen while it has moved over water today.  The 
aircraft also reported a fairly stable minimum pressure of 1001-1003 
mb during its mission this morning and early afternoon.
 
The intensity forecast philosophy remains the same as the previous 
advisory.  Once Laura moves over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico 
tonight, a combination of warm sea surface temperatures and low 
vertical wind shear should allow for steady strengthening. The 
latest iterations of the global and regional hurricane models 
continue to show significant deepening while Laura traverses the 
Gulf of Mexico, and a period or rapid strengthening is possible once 
an inner core is able to organize. The statistical guidance is 
again on the lower side of the intensity forecast envelope 
while the HWRF and CTCI models bringing Laura to major hurricane 
strength. The NHC intensity forecast is again between these 
solutions and is close to the consensus aids.
 
The initial motion estimate is 290/16 kt. A deep-layer ridge over
the western Atlantic is expected to build westward during the next
day or so.  By early Wednesday, a mid- to upper-level trough over
the south-central United States is forecast to erode the western
portion of the ridge, which should cause Laura to turn northwestward
and then northward toward the northwestern Gulf coast.  After 
landfall, Laura or its remnants are expected to become embedded 
in the mid-latitude westerlies and recurve over the eastern U.S. 
on days 4 and 5.  The latest runs of the dynamical models are in a 
little better agreement, but the 1200 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean is 
located considerably left of its deterministic run, indicating that 
uncertainty regarding the track forecast remains.  Users are again 
reminded to not to focus on the exact details of the track or 
intensity forecasts as the average NHC track error at 60 h is 
around 90 miles and the average intensity error is close to 15 mph.  
In addition, wind, storm surge, and rainfall hazards will extend 
far from the center.

The new NHC forecast necessitates the issuance of storm surge and 
hurricane watches for portions of the U.S. Gulf Coast. 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Laura is forecast to reach the northwestern Gulf Coast as a 
hurricane late Wednesday and early Thursday. Do not focus 
on the details of the official forecast given the typical 
uncertainty in NHC's 2 to 3 day track and intensity predictions. In 
addition, storm surge, wind, and rainfall hazards will extend well 
away from Laura's center along the Gulf Coast. 

2. There is a risk of life-threatening storm surge from San Luis 
Pass, Texas, to Ocean Springs, Mississippi, within the next 48 
hours, and a storm surge watch has been issued for these areas 
outside of the southeast Louisiana Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk 
Reduction System. Residents in these areas should follow any advice 
given by local officials.

3. Hurricane conditions are possible by late Wednesday from Port 
Bolivar, Texas, to west of Morgan City, Louisiana, with tropical 
storm conditions possible by Wednesday afternoon, and a hurricane 
watch has been issued. Additional hurricane watches may be needed 
farther south along the Texas coast if the track forecast shifts 
toward the south and west tonight and Tuesday. 

4. Tropical storm conditions and heavy rainfall are expected across 
central and western Cuba through tonight. These rains could cause 
mudslides and life-threatening flash and urban flooding.

Gusty winds, heavy rainfall, and lingering coastal flooding are
expected from Marco along portions of the Gulf Coast through this
evening. For information on these hazards see products from your
local National Weather Service office.
 
Tropical cyclone wind and surge watches have been issued for
portions of the U.S. Gulf Coast for Tropical Storm Laura.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Marco was 
located near latitude 29.0 North, longitude 88.9 West.  Marco is 
moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h), a turn to the 
west-northwest and a slight increase in forward speed is expected 
to occur tonight. On the forecast track, Marco will move inland 
over southeastern Louisiana tonight, and across southern Louisiana 
on Tuesday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Weakening is expected, and Marco is forecast to become a
tropical depression tonight and degenerate to a remnant low on
Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) 
from the center.  A National Ocean Service weather station located 
on Petit Bois Island, Mississippi recently reported a wind gust to 
38 mph (61 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
WIND:  Wind gusts to tropical storm force are possible over the
coastal sections of southeastern Louisiana and Mississippi through
this evening.
 
RAINFALL:  Marco is expected to produce additional rainfall 
accumulations of 2 to 4 inches with additional isolated totals of 7 
inches across portions of the north-central Gulf coast and 
southeastern United States through Wednesday.   Rain totals related 
to Marco near Apalachicola, Florida reached as high as 11.81 inches 
on Sunday per a CoCoRaHS report.  The additional rainfall may result 
in areas of flash, urban and small stream flooding along the same 
area.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Marco are likely to affect portions of
the northern Gulf Coast for the next day or so. These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
TORNADOES:  A couple of tornadoes are possible late this afternoon 
through tonight across the Florida Panhandle, southern Georgia, far 
southern Alabama, and far southern Mississippi. 
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Marco Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL142020
400 PM CDT Mon Aug 24 2020
 
There has been little change to the structure of Marco over the past
few hours, with the deep convection and associated heavy rainfall
being sheared well to the northeast of the exposed center of
circulation. Based on earlier Hurricane Hunter aircraft and
scatterometer data, there was a small area of tropical-storm-force 
winds in the strongest convection located about 50-75 n
mi offshore of the northern Gulf coast. Since the shower and 
thunderstorm activity is persisting, it is assumed that these winds
are still occurring in that offshore area and the initial intensity
is being held at 35 kt.
 
The exposed vortex should continue to spin down as the center of the 
cyclone reaches the southeastern Louisiana coast late this evening, 
which would result in the coastal areas being spared from 
experiencing sustained tropical-storm-force winds. The 
official NHC forecast shows Marco weakening to a tropical 
depression tonight, which is in agreement with the model guidance. 
Strong vertical wind shear should strip away any remaining 
convection associated with Marco at some point tonight, as indicated 
by GFS and ECMWF simulated satellite imagery. When the convection 
does diminish, most of the model guidance does not show any 
significant new convection developing thereafter. So it is 
anticipated that Marco will degenerate to a remnant low by Tuesday.
 
Marco's initial motion is northwest at 6 kt. As the cyclone 
continues to weaken and degenerate to a remnant low, a turn to the 
west-northwest is expected as the system becomes steered in the 
low-level flow. The latest NHC track forecast is little changed from 
the previous one, and is near the TVCN consensus track guidance.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Gusty winds, heavy rainfall, and lingering coastal flooding are
expected from Marco along portions of the Gulf Coast through this
evening. For information on these hazards see products from your
local National Weather Service office.
 
2. Tropical Storm Laura could bring dangerous storm surge, rainfall, 
and wind impacts to portions of the U.S. Gulf Coast by the middle of 
the week, and tropical cyclone wind and surge watches have been 
issued for portions of the U.S. Gulf Coast.
