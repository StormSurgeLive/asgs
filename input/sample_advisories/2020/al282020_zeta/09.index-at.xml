DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Zeta was located
near latitude 19.5 North, longitude 86.0 West.  Zeta is moving
toward the northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h).  A northwestward motion
with some increase in forward speed is expected over the next day or
so, followed by a turn toward the north Tuesday night. A faster
northward to north-northeastward motion is forecast on Wednesday. On
the forecast track, the center of Zeta will move over the northern
Yucatan Peninsula later today or tonight, move over the southern
Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, and approach the northern Gulf Coast in 
the watch area on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 80 mph (130 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Some additional strengthening is possible before Zeta makes
landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula.  Some weakening is likely while
Zeta moves over the Yucatan Peninsula late tonight and early
Tuesday.  Zeta is forecast to strengthen again when it moves over
the southern Gulf of Mexico later on Tuesday and be at or near 
hurricane strength when it approaches the northern Gulf Coast on 
Wednesday. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles
(185 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 981 mb (28.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Zeta can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header WTNT43
KNHC, and on the web at <a href="http://www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml">www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml</a>.

STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
as much as 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate
coast in the Hurricane Warning area near and to the north of where
the center makes landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause 
normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters 
moving inland from the shoreline.  The water could reach the 
following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if 
the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...

Port Fourchon LA to Dauphin Island AL including Lake Borgne...4-6 
ft
Intracoastal City LA to Port Fourchon LA including Vermilion 
Bay...2-4 ft
Dauphin Island AL to Navarre FL including Mobile Bay and Pensacola 
Bay...2-4 ft    
Lake Pontchartrain...2-4 ft
Navarre FL to Yankeetown FL including Choctawhatchee Bay and Saint 
Andrew Bay...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding 
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle, 
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
RAINFALL:  Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with local amounts of 12
inches are possible through Tuesday along and east-northeast of
Zetas track across the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, the Cayman
Islands, and central to western Cuba.
 
An initial area of heavy rains will begin to impact the central Gulf
Coast Tuesday night, spreading north into the Tennessee Valley on
Wednesday. The core of the heavy rains associated with Zeta will
push northeast from eastern Louisiana across southern Mississippi,
Alabama and northern Georgia through Wednesday night, and through 
the southern Appalachians into the Mid-Atlantic on Thursday.  
Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated amounts of 6 inches 
are expected across these areas, resulting in flash, urban, small
stream, and minor river flooding.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane 
Warning area in the Yucatan Peninsula this evening.  Tropical storm 
conditions are expected within the Tropical Storm Warning area in 
Mexico this evening.  

Hurricane conditions are possible within the Hurricane Watch area on 
the northern Gulf Coast late Wednesday, and tropical storm 
conditions are possible within the Tropical Storm Watch area on the 
northern Gulf Coast late Wednesday. 

 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 PM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 PM CDT.

Tropical Storm Zeta Discussion Number   8
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL282020
1000 AM CDT Mon Oct 26 2020
 
After a significant strengthening episode early this morning, Zeta 
appears to have changed little in intensity recently. High spatial 
and temporal resolution GOES-16 visible satellite images indicate 
that the low-level center of the storm is located near the 
northwestern edge of the main area of vigorous deep convection.  The 
current intensity estimate is held at 60 kt which is the average of 
recent Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB.  An Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate Zeta in a few 
hours, and should provide a better estimate of the strength of the 
storm.
 
Zeta is moving northwestward, or about 305/9 kt.  A mid-level high 
pressure area centered just east of Florida should steer the 
tropical cyclone on a continued northwestward heading for the next 
day or so, taking center over the northern part of the Yucatan 
Peninsula.  By around 48 hours, Zeta is expected to turn northward 
over the Gulf along the western side of the high. Afterward, a 
shortwave trough moving into the southern Plains should induce a 
turn toward the north-northeast and take the center inland over the 
southern United States.  The system should then move fairly quickly 
northeastward across the eastern U.S. and emerge into the Atlantic 
by day 4.  The official track forecast has been adjusted a bit to 
the west of the previous one but not quite as far west as the 
corrected model consensus.
 
Zeta is apparently experiencing some north-northwesterly shear given 
the displacement of the low-level center from the convection. 
However, this shear is expected to abate very soon, and the cyclone 
is likely to strengthen into a hurricane before reaching the 
northeastern Yucatan Peninsula.  Some weakening should occur while 
Zeta interacts with land during the next 12 to 24 hours. The 
atmospheric and oceanic environment should be somewhat conducive 
while the system moves over the southern Gulf of Mexico in a day or 
two, and the official forecast shows some re-strengthening in 24-36 
hours.  Later in the forecast period, when Zeta approaches the 
northern Gulf Coast, cooler shelf waters and some increase in 
southwesterly shear could cause some weakening.  The official 
intensity forecast is similar to the previous ones and shows Zeta 
still near hurricane strength at landfall along the northern 
Gulf of Mexico coast, which is near or above most of the model 
guidance.  Zeta is likely to become an extratropical cyclone when it 
emerges into the Atlantic, and be absorbed by a frontal system 
around the end of the forecast period.
 
Given the timing of the track and the forecast wind radii, watches
will likely be required for a portion of the northern Gulf Coast
later today.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Hurricane conditions and dangerous storm surge are expected in 
portions of the northern Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico tonight and 
early Tuesday.  Tropical storm conditions could occur over extreme 
western Cuba beginning later today.
 
2. Through Tuesday, heavy rainfall is expected from Zeta across the
Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, the Cayman Islands, and central to
western Cuba. This rainfall may lead to flash flooding in urban
areas.  Between Tuesday night and Thursday, heavy rainfall is
expected from portions of the central U.S. Gulf Coast into the
southern Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic States near and in advance
of Zeta. This rainfall will lead to flash, urban, small stream, and
minor river flooding.
 
3. Zeta is forecast to be at or near hurricane strength when it
approaches the northern Gulf Coast on Wednesday, and there is an
increasing risk of dangerous storm surge, wind, and rainfall 
impacts from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle. Residents in these 
areas should monitor the progress of Zeta, as Hurricane and Storm 
Surge watches will likely be issued later today.
