...EPSILON BECOMES A POWERFUL POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE OVER THE
NORTH ATLANTIC...
...THIS WILL BE THE LAST NHC ADVISORY ON EPSILON...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM GMT...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...48.6N 38.8W
ABOUT 675 MI...1090 KM ENE OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...70 MPH...110 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 55 DEGREES AT 46 MPH...74 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...968 MB...28.59 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM GMT (0300 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone
Epsilon was located near latitude 48.6 North, longitude 38.8 West.
The post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the northeast near 46 mph
(74 km/h), and this general motion is expected to continue through 
Monday night. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is forecast during the next day 
or so before the post-tropical cyclone is absorbed by a large 
extratropical low pressure system on Monday night or early Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 450 miles (720 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 968 mb (28.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Large swells generated by Epsilon will affect Bermuda, the
Bahamas, the Greater Antilles, the Leeward Islands, portions of the
east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada through Monday.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane 
Center on Epsilon. Additional information on this system can be 
found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, 
under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at

Post-Tropical Cyclone Epsilon Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL272020
300 AM GMT Mon Oct 26 2020
 
Recent satellite-derived wind data indicate that Epsilon no longer 
has the structure of a tropical cyclone. The low-level circulation 
is stretched out along a north-south axis, with an area of lighter 
winds noted near and north of the ill-defined center. Furthermore, 
infrared cloud tops have warmed over the past several hours as 
convection wanes near the center. Therefore, Epsilon has been 
declared a post-tropical cyclone, and this will be the last NHC 
advisory for the system.

A partial 22Z ASCAT-A overpass showed at least 55-kt winds in the 
southern semicircle of the cyclone, which supports keeping the 
initial intensity at 60 kt. Post-tropical Epsilon is firmly embedded 
in the mid-latitude westerlies, and the cyclone will continue racing 
northeastward at around 35-40 kt for the next day or so. The cyclone 
will remain a very powerful and dangerous storm until it is absorbed 
by another large extratropical low pressure system over the 
northeastern Atlantic. The global models remain in very good 
agreement with this scenario, and no notable changes were made to 
the official NHC forecast.

Additional information on this system can be found in High Seas
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM EDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Zeta was
located by a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 18.7 
North, longitude 84.3 West. Zeta is moving toward the northwest 
near 9 mph (15 km/h).  A northwestward motion with an increase in 
forward speed is expected over the day or so, followed by a turn 
toward the north Tuesday night. A faster northward to 
north-northeastward motion is forecast on Wednesday.   On the 
forecast track, the center of Zeta will move near or over the 
northern Yucatan Peninsula later today or tonight, move over the 
southern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, and approach the northern Gulf 
Coast on Wednesday.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum 
sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Strengthening is forecast, and Zeta is expected to become a 
hurricane later this morning.  Additional strengthening is expected 
before Zeta moves over the Yucatan Peninsula.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 115 miles (185 km)
from the center.
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA 
reconnaissance aircraft data is 990 mb (29.24 inches).

<title>Tropical Storm Zeta Forecast Discussion Number 6</title>

Tropical Storm Zeta Discussion Number   6
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL282020
1100 PM EDT Sun Oct 25 2020
 
The tropical storm continues to produce deep convection on its south
side, with the low-level center estimated to be near the northern
edge of the thunderstorms.  The last pass from the NOAA Hurricane
Hunters a few hours ago indicated that the minimum pressure had
fallen to 997 mb, and since the storm appears better organized than
before the initial intensity is nudged up to 50 kt.  This intensity
estimate is slightly above the latest Dvorak numbers. The NOAA
Hurricane Hunters are planning to be in Zeta again overnight and
that data will be helpful in assessing the storm's intensity and
structure.
 
Zeta has not moved much during the past several hours, and the 
initial motion is a very slow north-northwest drift.  As ridging 
begins to build over and near Florida, Zeta is forecast to move 
faster to the northwest overnight and Monday, and that should take 
the center of the cyclone near or over the northeastern portion of 
the Yucatan Peninsula in about 24 hours.  The ridge is then expected 
to shift eastward over the western Atlantic on Tuesday and Wednesday 
as a large and quite powerful mid- to upper-level low moves eastward 
across the southwest and south-central United States.  This change 
in the steering pattern should cause Zeta to accelerate northward 
toward the northern Gulf Coast, and likely make landfall there on 
Wednesday.  The models remain in poor agreement on the details of 
the evolution of the steering pattern and consequently, there is 
about a 300 n mi spread in the landfall locations from the various 
models, which currently spans the region from the far western 
Florida panhandle to western Louisiana.  The NHC track forecast is a 
little west of the previous one trending toward the middle of the 
guidance envelope. Based on the poor model agreement, the confidence 
in the track forecast is lower than normal.  It is hoped that data 
being collected by the NOAA Gulfstream jet flying around Zeta 
and special NWS weather balloon launches will help the models come 
into better agreement on the future track of Zeta soon.
 
Given the low wind shear conditions, moist air mass, and high
oceanic heat content over the northwestern Caribbean, steady
strengthening seems likely until Zeta reaches the Yucatan Peninsula
by late Monday.  The cyclone is expected to be a hurricane at
landfall in Mexico, and the new forecast shows a slightly higher
intensity there based on the new models and favorable conditions.
The models differ on how long the core of Zeta will be inland over
the Yucatan, but in general, it seems likely that significant
weakening won't occur given the storm's expected increasing forward
speed.  The overall environmental conditions are anticipated to
remain generally favorable while Zeta moves across the southern Gulf
of Mexico, but there should be an increase in shear when it reaches
the central Gulf and the cyclone will then be moving over the
cooler shelf waters over the northern Gulf.  The combination of the
stronger shear and cooler waters should cause Zeta to level off
in strength and perhaps weaken slightly before the U.S. landfall.
The intensity models are in fair agreement, and the NHC forecast
lies near the HCCA and IVCN consensus models.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Hurricane conditions and storm surge are expected in portions of
the northern Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico Monday night and early
Tuesday. Tropical storm conditions could occur over extreme western
Cuba on Monday.
 
2. Through Wednesday, heavy rainfall is expected from Zeta across
portions of central and western Cuba, the Cayman Islands, Jamaica,
the northeast Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, southern Florida and the
Keys. This rainfall could lead to flash flooding in urban areas.
 
3. Zeta is forecast to be at or near hurricane strength when
it approaches the northern Gulf Coast on Wednesday, and there is an
increasing risk of storm surge, rainfall, and wind impacts from
Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle. Residents in these areas should
monitor the progress of Zeta and updates to the forecast.
