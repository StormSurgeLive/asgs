DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1000 PM CDT (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Zeta was located
near latitude 31.5 North, longitude 88.7 West. Zeta is moving toward
the northeast near 31 mph (50 km/h). An even faster northeastward
motion is expected overnight through Thursday, then a rapid
east-northeastward motion is anticipated through Friday.  On the 
forecast track, the center of Zeta will move into southern Alabama 
soon and then move quickly across the southeastern eastern United 
States through Thursday before emerging offshore of Mid-Atlantic 
coast late Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Further weakening is expected, and Zeta should
decay into a tropical storm overnight and into a non-tropical
gale-force low Thursday morning.  The low should become absorbed by
a frontal system over the western Atlantic on Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).  Mobile Regional Airport recently;y reported sustained 
winds of 48 mph (78 km/h) and a wind gust of 91 mph (146 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Zeta can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and
on the web at <a href="http://www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml">www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml</a>.
 
STORM SURGE:  Along the northern Gulf Coast, the combination of a
dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas
near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the
shoreline.  The water could reach the following heights above ground
somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the
time of high tide...
 
East of the Mouth of the Pearl River to Dauphin Island AL...4-7 ft
Mobile Bay...4-6 ft
Dauphin Island AL to AL/FL border...3-5 ft
AL/FL border to Navarre FL including Pensacola Bay...2-4 ft
Mouth of the Atchafalaya River to the Mouth of the Pearl
River...1-3 ft
Lake Maurepas, Lake Pontchartrain, and Lake Borgne...1-3 ft
Navarre FL to Yankeetown FL including Choctawhatchee Bay and Saint
Andrew Bay...1-3 ft

The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane or Tropical Storm conditions are expected to
continue within the Warning areas near the northern Gulf Coast
overnight.
 
Damaging winds, especially in gusts, will spread well inland across
portions of southeastern Mississippi, Alabama, and northern Georgia
this evening through early Thursday morning, and into the Carolinas
and southeastern Virginia on Thursday.  Wind gusts could be
especially severe across the southern Appalachian Mountains on
Thursday.
 
RAINFALL:  Areas of heavy rainfall, both in advance of Zeta and
along the track of Zeta, will impact areas from the central Gulf
Coast to the Mid-Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, and east into the
southern to central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic through Thursday.
Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated amounts of 6 inches
are expected across these areas, resulting in flash, urban, small
stream, and minor river flooding.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible overnight over parts of
southern Alabama and the western Panhandle of Florida.  An isolated
tornado or two is possible tomorrow across much of the Carolinas and
southern Virginia.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 100 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 400 AM CDT.

Hurricane Zeta Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL282020
400 PM CDT Wed Oct 28 2020
 
The center of Zeta is in the Terrebone Bay area of Louisiana and 
is making landfall near Cocodrie.  Somewhat surprisingly, Zeta has 
rapidly intensified this afternoon. Although the hurricane has been 
moving over marginally warm SSTs and relatively low heat content 
waters, it has intensified from 80 kt to 95 kt in about 6 hours.  It 
is possible that this intensification can be at least partly 
attributable to a conducive interaction with with an upper-level 
trough located a few hundred miles to the west-northwest of Zeta.  
The 95-kt intensity estimate for Zeta is based on a blend of 
flight-level, SFMR and dropsonde winds from an Air Force Reserve 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft.
 
Since the center will either be interacting with land or moving over 
land from this point, a weakening trend should begin tonight.  The 
official intensity forecast is close to the Decay-SHIPS guidance, 
which should handle the exponential decay of wind seed for tropical 
cyclones moving over land.  In 24 hours or so, the global models 
depict the system as being embedded in a front while it approaches 
the United States east coast.  Thus the official forecast shows an 
extratropical cyclone at that point and beyond.  After 48 hours, the 
models show the low becoming elongated and absorbed into the frontal 
zone.

Zeta has turned toward the north-northeast and the forward speed is
increasing, with the motion now 025/21 kt.  The cyclone should
accelerate north-northeastward ahead of a 500-mb trough through
tonight.  The system should then move even faster toward the 
northeast, ahead of the trough, and across the southeastern and 
eastern United States on Thursday. Post-tropical Zeta should move 
east-northeastward, in the mid-level westerlies, into the Atlantic 
Friday morning.  The official track forecast follows the correct 
model consensus, HCCA, rather closely. 

Given Zeta's acceleration after landfall, strong winds are likely 
to spread well inland over the southeastern U.S. overnight and 
early Thursday.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. A life-threatening storm surge is beginning along portions of the 
northern Gulf Coast, with the highest inundation expected to occur 
somewhere between Port Fourchon, Louisiana, and Dauphin Island, 
Alabama, especially along the Mississippi coast. Overtopping of 
local, non-federal levee systems is possible within southeastern 
Louisiana outside of the Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction 
System. 

2.  Extremely dangerous hurricane conditions are spreading across 
portions of the Hurricane Warning area along the southeastern 
Louisiana coast and will spread to the Mississippi coast this 
evening.  Tropical storm conditions will spread into portions of the 
Tropical Storm Warning area along the Alabama and far western 
Florida Panhandle coasts in the next few hours.  

3.  Strong, damaging wind gusts, which could cause tree damage and 
power outages, will spread well inland across portions of 
southeastern Mississippi, Alabama, northern Georgia, the Carolinas, 
and southeastern Virginia tonight and Thursday due to Zeta's fast 
forward speed.  Wind gusts could be especially severe across the 
southern Appalachian Mountains on Thursday.

4.  Through Thursday, heavy rainfall is expected from portions of 
the central U.S. Gulf Coast into the Mid-Mississippi Valley, Ohio 
Valley, southern to central Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic States 
near and in advance of Zeta. This rainfall will lead to flash, 
urban, small stream, and minor river flooding.
