SUMMARY OF 200 PM EDT...1800 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...37.8N 78.2W
ABOUT 25 MI...45 KM SSE OF CHARLOTTESVILLE VIRGINIA
ABOUT 50 MI...85 KM WNW OF RICHMOND VIRGINIA

MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...992 MB...29.29 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM EDT (1800 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Zeta 
was located near latitude 37.8 North, longitude 78.2 West.  Zeta is
moving rapidly toward the east-northeast near 53 mph (85 km/h).  An
even faster motion toward the east-northeast is expected tonight and
on Friday.  On the forecast track, the center of Zeta will continue
to move across Virginia this afternoon, and emerge over the western
Atlantic by this evening.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Some strengthening is forecast once Zeta moves over the
western Atlantic, but the cyclone should become absorbed by a
frontal system by Friday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 275 miles (445 km)
mainly to the southeast of the center.  A sustained wind of 51 mph
(82 km/h) and a gust to 72 mph (116 km/h) were recently reported at
a station in Conway, North Carolina, to the east of Roanoke Rapids.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 992 mb (29.29 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Zeta can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and
on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml.
 
WIND:  Damaging winds, especially in gusts, will continue to spread
across portions of eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia
through this evening.
 
RAINFALL:  Areas of heavy rainfall, both in advance of Zeta and
along the track of Zeta, will impact areas from the central
Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic and lower to middle Ohio Valley through
Thursday. Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected across these
areas, resulting in possible flash, urban, small stream, and
isolated minor river flooding.
 
TORNADOES:  A tornado or two is possible this afternoon across the
Carolinas and southern Virginia.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM EDT.

Tropical Storm Zeta Discussion Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL282020
1100 AM EDT Thu Oct 29 2020
 
Zeta continues to move rapidly over land, and its maximum sustained 
winds are estimated to be near 45 kt over the southeastern 
quadrant, with thew highest winds occuring over elevated locations. 
The wind gust factor continues to be higher than usual due to the 
interaction with land.

Zeta continues to accelerate northeastward and is now moving near 
055/42 kt.  The cyclone should accelerate some more ahead of a 
strong 500-mb trough moving into the eastern United States over the 
next day or so.  The official track forecast is in reasonable 
agreement with the global model predictions.  
 
The pressure pattern of Zeta is becoming distorted, and starting to 
take on an extratropical appearance as the cyclone begins to 
interact with a nearby frontal system.  By this afternoon, the 
global models indicate that the system will become a frontal low and 
thus extratropical.  Some short-term baroclinic strengthening is 
possible over the western Atlantic, but the guidance suggests that 
the system will become absorbed into the frontal zone in 36 hours 
or so.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Strong, damaging wind gusts, which could cause tree damage and
power outages, will continue to spread eastward across portions of 
the Carolinas and southeastern Virginia through this afternoon due 
to Zeta's fast forward speed. 

2.  Through today, heavy rainfall is expected near and in advance of 
Zeta from portions of the Ohio Valley, into the central Appalachians 
and Mid-Atlantic.  This rainfall may lead to flash, urban, small 
stream, and isolated minor river flooding.
