WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Epsilon was
located near latitude 44.3 North, longitude 49.4 West.  Epsilon is
moving toward the east-northeast near 35 mph (56 km/h). A faster 
east-northeastward to northeastward motion is expected later 
tonight through Monday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Little change in strength is expected today and Epsilon is 
forecast to become a large and powerful extratropical cyclone by 
tonight.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 0 miles (0 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 380 miles
(610 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 960 mb (28.35 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Large swells generated by Epsilon will affect Bermuda, the
Bahamas, the Greater Antilles, the Leeward Islands, portions of the
east coast of the United States, and Atlantic Canada during the next
couple of days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Epsilon Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL272020
1100 AM AST Sun Oct 25 2020
 
Epsilon continues its extratropical transition, as the cloud tops
near the center of circulation are warming while the cloud pattern
continues to expand over the northern portion of the circulation.
The initial intensity is being held at 65 kt for this advisory 
based on early morning ASCAT data.  Partial data from a more recent 
scatterometer pass also suggested this intensity. 
 
The cyclone is now moving over waters of only 17 degrees C and the
waters ahead of the system are even cooler than that.  Epsilon
is also interacting with a baroclinic zone as evidenced by a large
area of cool and stable air stratocumulus wrapping around the
southwestern portion of the circulation.  These factors should cause
what remains of the inner-core convection to weaken over the next
several hours, and the system should complete its extratropical
transition by tonight.  The post-tropical cyclone will remain
large and powerful for the next day or so until it is absorbed by
another large extratropical low over the north Atlantic in about
36-48 h.
 
Epsilon is moving quickly east-northeastward at around 30 kt. The
cyclone is expected to accelerate even more today, with a fast
east-northeastward or northeastward motion expected until the
system is absorbed by the other low. The latest NHC forecast track
is little changed from the previous one and lies in the middle of
the tightly clustered consensus guidance.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM EDT (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Zeta was
located near latitude 17.8 North, longitude 83.8 West.  Zeta is 
nearly stationary, but a generally northwestward motion is 
expected over the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the 
center of Zeta will pass south of western Cuba early Monday and move 
near or over the northern Yucatan Peninsula or the Yucatan Channel 
late Monday, move into the southern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, and 
reach the central Gulf of Mexico by late Tuesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Some strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and 
Zeta could become a hurricane by the time it moves near or over the 
Yucatan Peninsula late Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Zeta can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header
WTNT43 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches with local amounts of 12 
inches are possible through Wednesday along and east-northeast of 
Zetas track from Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, central to western 
Cuba,  and the northeast Yucatan peninsula of Mexico.  Additional 
rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches with local amounts of 5 inches are
possible across southern Florida and the Keys over the next 2 days, 
with isolated storm totals of 8 inches.  

By Wednesday, heavy rainfall associated with Zeta will begin to 
affect the central Gulf Coast region, which may lead to flash 
flooding in urban areas.

WIND:  Hurricane conditions are possible within the Hurricane Watch
area in the Yucatan Peninsula by late Monday.  Tropical storm 
conditions are expected within the warning area in the Yucatan
peninsula late Monday, and could occur in the warning area in 
Western Cuba on Monday.
 
STORM SURGE:  A dangerous storm surge will raise water levels by
as much as 1-3 feet above normal tide levels along the immediate
coast in the Hurricane Watch area near and to the north of where
the center makes landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula.

<title>Tropical Storm Zeta Forecast Discussion Number 4</title>

Tropical Storm Zeta Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL282020
1100 AM EDT Sun Oct 25 2020

Although the cloud pattern of the storm is not well-organized and 
somewhat elongated zonally, the system is producing very vigorous 
deep convection, particularly over the southern portion of the 
circulation.  Cirrus cloud motions show that the upper-level 
outflow is well-defined.  The current intensity estimate remains at 
35 kt in agreement with Dvorak values from both TAFB and SAB, and 
pending another Hurricane Hunter mission into the system this 
afternoon.  

The center is difficult to locate at this time, and the best 
estimate for motion is quasi-stationary.  A high pressure area 
developing near Florida should induce a general northwestward 
motion over the next couple of days.  Later, a shortwave trough 
approaching from the west is likely to cause Zeta to turn northward 
and north-northeastward while it nears the northern Gulf Coast in 
72-84 hours.  The official track forecast lies between the GFS 
solution which is farther east and the ECMWF prediction which lies 
farther south and west.

Given the favorable upper-level outflow pattern and very high 
oceanic heat content over the northwestern Caribbean, strengthening 
is likely until the center moves near or over the Yucatan Peninsula 
late tomorrow.  Zeta should be near or at hurricane strength when it 
approaches the Yucatan.  The official intensity forecast for the 
next 36 hours is close to the model consensus.  After Zeta moves 
into the central Gulf of Mexico, increasing southwesterly shear and 
diminishing oceanic heat content are expected to prevent 
strengthening.  The NHC intensity forecast over the Gulf is above 
the latest model consensus.  Although not explicitly shown in the 
official forecast, the unfavorable atmospheric and oceanic 
conditions over the northern Gulf of Mexico could cause Zeta 
to weaken by the time the center nears the northern Gulf coast.  
However, users are reminded that these intensity forecasts are 
subject to uncertainty.

KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the 
northern Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico Monday night and early Tuesday, 
with hurricane conditions possible.  Tropical storm conditions 
could occur over extreme western Cuba on Monday.
 
2. Through Wednesday, heavy rainfall is expected from Zeta across 
portions of central and western Cuba, the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, 
the northeast Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, southern Florida and the 
Keys. This rainfall may lead to flash flooding in urban areas.
 
3. Zeta could be at or just below hurricane strength when it 
approaches the northern Gulf Coast on Wednesday, and could bring 
storm surge, rainfall, and wind impacts to areas from Louisiana to 
the Florida Panhandle. Residents in these areas should monitor the 
progress of Zeta and updates to the forecast.
