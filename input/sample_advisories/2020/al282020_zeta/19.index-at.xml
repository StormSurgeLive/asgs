WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Storm Surge Warning has been discontinued.  Information on
ongoing coastal flooding can be found in coastal flood products
issued by local National Weather Service offices.
 
The Tropical Storm Warning from the Mississippi-Alabama border to
west of Navarre, Florida, has been canceled.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Warning is in effect for...
* Navarre to Walton/Bay County Line Florida
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 AM CDT (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Zeta was
located near latitude 34.0 North, longitude 85.5 West. Zeta is
racing toward the northeast near 39 mph (63 km/h). An even
faster northeastward motion is expected later today, followed by a
rapid east-northeastward motion tonight and Friday.  On the forecast
track, the center of Zeta will move across portions of the
southeastern U.S. this morning, across the Mid-Atlantic states this
afternoon, and emerge over the western Atlantic by tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts.
Zeta is expected to become a non-tropical gale-force low later 
today.  The low should become absorbed by a frontal system over the 
western Atlantic by Friday night.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on surface 
observations is 988 mb (29.18 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Zeta can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and
on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  Water levels along the Central Gulf coast will
gradually subside throughout the day. Consult products issued by
your local National Weather Service forecast office for additional
information.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue within
the warning area near the northern Gulf Coast for a few more hours.
 
Damaging winds, especially in gusts, are spreading well inland
across portions of central and northern Alabama, and northern
Georgia, and these winds will shift into eastern Tennessee, the 
Carolinas, and southeastern Virginia later today.  Wind gusts could 
be especially severe across the southern Appalachian Mountains.
 
RAINFALL:  Areas of heavy rainfall, both in advance of Zeta and
along the track of Zeta, will impact areas from the central
Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic and lower to middle Ohio Valley through
Thursday. Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected across these
areas, resulting in possible flash, urban, small stream, and
isolated minor river flooding.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes could occur this morning from parts of 
the Florida Panhandle across southeastern Alabama and Georgia.  A
tornado or two is possible later today over the Carolinas and
southern Virginia.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 700 AM CDT.
Next complete advisory at 1000 AM CDT.

Tropical Storm Zeta Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL282020
400 AM CDT Thu Oct 29 2020
 
Surface observations and Doppler radar data indicate that Zeta
weakened to a tropical storm around 0600 UTC when it was located
over central Alabama.  During the past few hours, the cyclone's
structure has degraded further with the center no longer easily
apparent in radar images and convection appearing more ragged and
asymmetric.  The initial intensity is lowered to 50 kt for this
advisory, and that could be a little generous.  The minimum
pressure is estimated to be 988 mb based on surface observations.
 
The storm continues to accelerate, and the latest initial motion is 
northeastward at 34 kt.  Zeta is expected to race northeastward 
today in the fast steering flow between a potent mid- to upper-level 
low to its west and a high pressure ridge to its southeast.  This 
pattern should take the cyclone across the southeast and 
Mid-Atlantic states throughout the day, before emerging over the 
western Atlantic this evening.  An even faster east-northeastward 
motion is predicted tonight and on Friday until the cyclone 
dissipates by Friday night.
 
The tropical storm is forecast to weaken a little more during the
next several hours as it remains over land, and Zeta will likely
become extratropical by the time it reaches the mid-Atlantic
states this afternoon.  However, after that time, the models show
the cyclone leveling off in strength or perhaps even
re-intensifying over the western Atlantic before it becomes
absorbed into a frontal zone in 36 to 48 hours.  The NHC intensity
forecast follows the GFS and ECMWF models.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1.  Strong, damaging wind gusts, which could cause tree damage and
power outages, will continue to spread well inland across portions
of northeastern Alabama, northern Georgia, the Carolinas, and
southeastern Virginia today due to Zeta's fast forward speed.  Wind
gusts could be especially severe across the southern Appalachian
Mountains.
 
2.  Through today, heavy rainfall is expected near and in advance of 
Zeta from portions of the central Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic and 
lower to middle Ohio Valley. This rainfall may lead to flash, urban, 
small stream, and isolated minor river flooding.
