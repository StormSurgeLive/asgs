A Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening
inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline in
the indicated locations. For a depiction of areas at risk, please
see the National Weather Service Storm Surge Watch/Warning Graphic,
available at hurricanes.gov.  This is a life-threatening situation.

instructions from local officials.
 
A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected
somewhere within the warning area.  Preparations to protect life and
property should be rushed to completion.
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, including possible
inland watches and warnings, please monitor products issued by your
local National Weather Service forecast office.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 100 PM CDT (1800 UTC), the center of Hurricane Zeta was located
near latitude 27.9 North, longitude 91.1 West.  Zeta is moving
toward the north-northeast near 20 mph (35 km/h).  A faster
north-northeastward motion is expected through tonight followed by
an even faster northeastward motion on Thursday and an
east-northeastward motion early Friday.  On the forecast track, the
center of Zeta will make landfall in southeastern Louisiana this
afternoon.  Zeta will then move close to the Mississippi coast this
evening, and move across the southeastern and eastern United States
on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 100 mph (155 km/h)
with higher gusts.  Some additional strengthening is possible during
the next few hours, and Zeta is expected to reach the northern Gulf
Coast as a hurricane before weakening over the southeastern United
States on Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).
 
The minimum central pressure reported by an Air Force Hurricane
Hunter aircraft is 975 mb (28.79 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Zeta can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3, WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and
on the web at www.hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT3.shtml.
 
STORM SURGE:  Along the northern Gulf Coast, the combination of a
dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas
near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the
shoreline.  The water could reach the following heights above ground
somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the
time of high tide...
 
Mouth of the Pearl River to Dauphin Island AL...6-9 ft
Port Fourchon LA to the Mouth of the Mississippi River...5-8 ft
Mouth of the Mississippi River to the Mouth of the Pearl River
including Lake Borgne...5-7 ft
Mouth of the Atchafalaya River to Port Fourchon LA...4-6 ft
Mobile Bay...4-6 ft
Dauphin Island AL to AL/FL border...3-5 ft
Lake Pontchartrain...3-5 ft
AL/FL border to Navarre FL including Pensacola Bay...2-4 ft
Intracoastal City LA to the Mouth of the Atchafalaya River including
Vermilion Bay...1-3 ft
Navarre FL to Yankeetown FL including Choctawhatchee Bay and Saint
Andrew Bay...1-3 ft
 
The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to
the right of the landfall location, where the surge will be
accompanied by large and dangerous waves.  Surge-related flooding
depends on the relative timing of the surge and the tidal cycle,
and can vary greatly over short distances.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.
 
WIND:  Hurricane conditions are expected within the Hurricane
Warning area on the northern Gulf Coast later this afternoon, with
tropical storm conditions beginning within the next few hours.
Tropical storm conditions are expected within the Tropical Storm
Warning area on the northern Gulf Coast by late today.
 
Damaging winds, especially in gusts, will spread well inland across
portions of southeastern Mississippi, Alabama, and northern Georgia
this evening through early Thursday morning, and into the Carolinas
and southeastern Virginia on Thursday.  Wind gusts could be
especially severe across the southern Appalachian Mountains on
Thursday.
 
RAINFALL:  Areas of heavy rainfall, both in advance of and along the
track of Zeta, will impact areas from the central Gulf Coast to
the Mid-Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, and eastward into the
southern to central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic today through
Thursday.  Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with isolated amounts
of 6 inches are expected across these areas, resulting in flash,
urban, small stream, and minor river flooding.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are expected this afternoon through
tonight over southeastern parts of Louisiana and Mississippi,
southern Alabama, and the western Panhandle of Florida.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 400 PM CDT.

Hourly Tropical Cyclone Updates will begin at 200 PM CDT.  These 
can be found under WMO header WTNT63 KNHC and under AWIPS header 
MIATCUAT3.

Hurricane Zeta Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL282020
1000 AM CDT Wed Oct 28 2020
 
Zeta has a well-organized cloud pattern on satellite images, and the
eye has been fairly well-defined.  Strong upper-level outflow is
evident over the northern semicircle of the hurricane.  Reports from
Air Force and NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that the
system had continued to strengthen over the past few hours.  Peak
700-mb flight level winds were 89 kt, which equates to a maximum
surface wind of about 80 kt, and The central pressure has fallen to
976 mb.  Zeta still has a few hours to intensify before it begins to
move over the cooler waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico, and
southwesterly shear is likely to increase by the time the center
reaches the coast.  Even if a little weakening begins later today,
however, Zeta should maintain hurricane strength through landfall.
The official intensity forecast is near the high end of the model
guidance.  In 36 hours or so, the global models clearly depict the
system as a frontal wave approaching the United States east coast so
the official forecast shows an extratropical cyclone at that point
and beyond.  After 48 hours, the models show the low becoming
elongated and absorbed into the frontal zone.
 
The hurricane has turned northward and is now moving at around
010/16 kt.  A strong 500-mb trough moving into Texas will continue
to move eastward during the next 36-48 hours.  The flow ahead of
this trough will cause Zeta to accelerate north-northeastward and
move inland along the central Gulf Coast in 6-12 hours.  On
Thursday, the cyclone will then move northeastward on the east
side of the trough, at an even faster pace, over the southeastern
United States.  By early Friday, the system should move east-
northeastward in the westerlies and into the western Atlantic as an
extratropical cyclone.  The official track forecast is close to the
previous one and generally follows the dynamical model consensus.
 
Given Zeta's acceleration near and after landfall, strong winds are
likely to spread well inland over the southeastern U.S. this evening
and early Thursday.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. A life-threatening storm surge is expected along portions of the
northern Gulf Coast beginning later today, with the highest
inundation occurring between Port Fourchon, Louisiana, and Dauphin
Island, Alabama. Residents in the Storm Surge Warning area should
follow any advice given by local officials.  Overtopping of local,
non-federal levee systems is possible within southeastern Louisiana
outside of the Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System.
 
2.  Hurricane conditions are expected this afternoon and evening
within portions of the Hurricane Warning area along the southeastern
Louisiana and Mississippi coasts.  Tropical storm conditions are
expected within portions of the Tropical Storm Warning area along
the Alabama and far western Florida Panhandle coasts.
 
3.  Strong, damaging wind gusts, which could cause tree damage and
power outages, will spread well inland across portions of
southeastern Mississippi, Alabama, northern Georgia, the Carolinas,
and southeastern Virginia tonight and Thursday due to Zeta's fast
forward speed.  Wind gusts could be especially severe across the
southern Appalachian Mountains on Thursday.
 
4.  Through Thursday, heavy rainfall is expected from portions of
the central U.S. Gulf Coast into the Mid-Mississippi Valley, Ohio
Valley, southern to central Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic States
near and in advance of Zeta. This rainfall will lead to flash,
urban, small stream, and minor river flooding.
