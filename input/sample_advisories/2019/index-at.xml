LOUISIANA...
...LIFE-THREATENING FLOODING RAINS TO CONTINUE INTO MONDAY...


SUMMARY OF 400 PM CDT...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...32.8N 93.6W
ABOUT 20 MI...35 KM NNE OF SHREVEPORT LOUISIANA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 360 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES


WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY...

All Tropical Storm Warnings have been discontinued.

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT...

There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.


DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 400 PM CDT (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Barry
was located by NOAA Doppler radars and surface observations near
latitude 32.8 North, longitude 93.6 West.  The depression is moving
toward the north near 9 mph (15 km/h) and this general motion is
forecast tonight through Monday morning.   A motion toward the
north-northeast and northeast is expected Monday afternoon into
Tuesday. On the forecast track, the center of Barry will move across
the northwestern portions of Louisiana today, and over Arkansas
tonight and Monday.

Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with
higher gusts.  These winds are occurring near the coast well to
the southeast and south of the center.  Further weakening is
expected as the center moves farther inland, and Barry is forecast
to degenerate into a remnant low pressure system by Monday night.

The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).


HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key Messages for Barry can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.

STORM SURGE:  Water levels along the southern coast of Louisiana
will continue to subside into this evening. However, some minor
coastal flooding is still possible through today.  For information
specific to your area, please see products issued by your local
National Weather Service forecast office.

RAINFALL:  Barry is expected to produce additional rain
accumulations of 3 to 6 inches across portions of the lower
Mississippi Valley with isolated maximum amounts of 10 inches across
eastern Arkansas, western Tennessee, southeast Missouri, and
northwest Mississippi.

Additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches with isolated storm
totals of 10-15 inches are expected across south-central Louisiana.
This additional rainfall will lead to dangerous, life threatening
flooding.

WIND:  Gale-force winds, especially in gusts, could occur across
the coastal areas of southwestern Louisiana into this evening.
However, these winds are not directly associated with Barry's
circulation.

TORNADOES:  A couple of tornadoes are possible through Sunday night
across parts of southeast Louisiana, Mississippi, western Alabama,
eastern Arkansas, and western Tennessee.


NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system.  Future information on this system can be
found in Public Advisories issued by the Weather Prediction Center
beginning at 10 PM CDT, under AWIPS header TCPAT2, WMO header
WTNT32 KWNH, and on the web at http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov.

Tropical Depression Barry Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL022019
400 PM CDT Sun Jul 14 2019

Barry's convective pattern in radar and satellite imagery has
continued to erode, and the center has become more difficult to
locate in radar imagery.  Surface observations from the Shreveport,
Louisiana, area were helpful in locating Barry's position.  Although
sustained surface winds of 34-36 kt have been occurring during the
past few hours at the NOAA NOS site at Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana
(PACL1), those winds are not directly associated with Barry's
circulation and are instead locally accelerated straight-line winds.
Therefore, Barry's intensity has been lowered to 30 kt for this
advisory, making the cyclone a tropical depression.

The initial motion estimate is 360/08 kt.  Barry is forecast to
continue moving northward tonight around the western periphery
of a deep-layer ridge, and then turn toward the north-northeast
and northeast late Monday into Tuesday.  The new NHC track forecast
is similar to the previous advisory track and lies close to a blend
of the various consensus models TCVA, TVDG, and HCCA.

Barry will weaken further during the next 48 hours as the cyclone
continues to move inland, degenerating into a post-tropical remnant
low pressure system by Monday night and dissipating on Tuesday over
the Middle Mississippi Valley.

Even though Barry is weakening, the threat of heavy rains and the
potential for flooding, including river flooding, will continue from
Louisiana northward through the Lower Mississippi Valley.

This will be the last advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on Barry.  Future information on this system can be found in
Public Advisories issued by the Weather Prediction Center beginning
at 10 PM CDT, under AWIPS header TCPAT2, WMO header WTNT32 KWNH, and
on the web at http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov.

Key Messages:

1. Life-threatening flash flooding is expected along Barry's path
inland from Louisiana through portions of Arkansas, Mississippi,
southeast Missouri, and western Tennessee through at least Monday.
Significant river flooding is also likely across south-central
Louisiana.

2. Gale-force winds, especially in gusts, will be possible into
this evening over the coastal areas of southwestern Louisiana.
However, these winds are not directly associated with Barry's
circulation.
