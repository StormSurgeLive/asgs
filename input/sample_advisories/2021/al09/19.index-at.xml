Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Mon Aug 30 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical  <br/>
Storm Ida, located inland over western Mississippi, and on recently <br/>
upgraded Tropical Storm Kate, located over the central tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Satellite-derived wind data and satellite imagery indicate that an <br/>
area of low pressure has formed over the far eastern Tropical <br/>
Atlantic in association with a tropical wave that recently moved off <br/>
the west coast of Africa.  Environmental conditions are conducive <br/>
for development, and a tropical depression is likely to form within <br/>
the next couple of days while the system moves west-northwestward at <br/>
10 to 15 mph over the eastern tropical Atlantic. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A broad area of low pressure is expected to form in the southern <br/>
Caribbean Sea by midweek. Environmental conditions appear to be <br/>
favorable for some slow development by the end of the week, as long <br/>
as the system remains over water.  This system is expected to move <br/>
gradually west-northwestward or northwestward at 5 to 10 mph over <br/>
the western Caribbean Sea near the east coast of Central America. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent. <br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

farther inland over central and northeastern Mississippi tonight. 
Ida is then forecast to move across the Tennessee Valley on 
Tuesday and near the central Appalachians on Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) 
with higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast during the 
next day or so. 
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from surface observations is 
999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Ida can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4, WMO header WTNT44 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?key_messages.
 
STORM SURGE:  Water levels along the northern Gulf coast should
continue to subside through this evening.
 
RAINFALL: Through Tuesday morning across portions of southeast 
Louisiana into far southern Mississippi, Ida will produce additional 
rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with localized higher amounts 
possible. Storm total rainfall accumulations of 10 to 18 inches with 
isolated maximum amounts of 24 inches is expected. Heavy rain 
combined with storm surge has resulted in catastrophic impacts along 
the southeast coast of Louisiana with considerable flash flooding 
and riverine flooding continuing farther inland. 

Ida will continue to turn northeast this evening and is forecast to 
track across the Middle Tennessee Valley, Ohio Valley and 
Mid-Atlantic through Wednesday, producing the following rainfall 
totals:

Coastal Alabama to the far western Florida panhandle: An additional 
3 to 6 inches resulting in storm total accumulations of 6 to 12 
inches with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches, today through 
Tuesday morning. 

Central Mississippi into far western Alabama: 4 to 8 inches with 
isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches, today through tonight. 

Middle Tennessee Valley, Ohio Valley, Central/Southern Appalachians 
into the Mid-Atlantic: 3 to 6 inches with isolated higher amounts, 
Tuesday into Wednesday. 

Southern New England: 2 to 4 inches with isolated higher amounts, 
Wednesday into Thursday.

Considerable flash flooding is possible from the Lower Mississippi 
Valley through the Middle Tennessee Valley, Ohio Valley, 
Central/Southern Appalachians, and into the Mid-Atlantic. Widespread 
minor to isolated major riverine flooding is occurring or forecast 
from the Lower Mississippi Valley into far western Alabama. Rivers 
will remain elevated into next week.
 
TORNADOES:  A few tornadoes are possible through tonight, mainly 
across far southeast Mississippi, the southern half of Alabama, and 
the western Florida Panhandle. The threat for a few tornadoes will 
shift east on Tuesday and become centered across eastern Alabama, 
western Georgia, and the Florida Panhandle. 
 
SURF:  Swells will continue to affect portions of the northern Gulf
coast through this evening.  These swells are likely to cause life-
threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Tropical Depression Ida Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL092021
400 PM CDT Mon Aug 30 2021
 
Ida has continued to weaken while moving farther inland over 
west-central Mississippi this afternoon.  Recent observations 
indicate that the stronger winds seen this morning along the 
northern Gulf coast have now dropped below tropical storm strength, 
and Ida has become a tropical depression.  Additional weakening 
should occur while Ida moves over northeastern Mississippi and the 
Tennessee Valley during the next 12 to 24 hours.  Ida is forecast to 
become an extratropical cyclone over the eastern United States by 
late Wednesday, and it is likely to be absorbed within a frontal 
boundary over the western Atlantic by the end of the forecast 
period.
 
Ida has turned northeastward and is now moving 020/8 kt.  A
mid- to upper-level trough approaching Ida from the west should
cause the cyclone to move faster toward the northeast over the next
couple of days.  The latest runs of the dynamical models are in a
bit better agreement regarding the forward speed of the Ida as it
moves across the eastern U.S., and the NHC track forecast is again
near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Although Ida's winds have decreased, the threat of heavy rainfall
and flooding will continue to spread inland over portions of the
Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, the Central and Southern Appalachians
and the Mid-Atlantic through Wednesday.

This is the last advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center 
on Ida.  Future information on this system can be found in Public
Advisories issued by the Weather Prediction Center beginning at 
10 PM CDT, under AWIPS header TCPAT4, WMO header WTNT34 KWNH, and 
on the web at http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov. 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Ida will continue to produce heavy rainfall tonight through
Tuesday morning across portions of southeast Louisiana, Mississippi,
and western Alabama, resulting in considerable flash and urban
flooding and significant river flooding impacts. Rivers in the
Lower Mississippi Valley will remain elevated into next week. As Ida
moves inland, additional considerable flooding impacts are likely
across portions of the Tennessee Valley, the Ohio Valley, and
particularly in the Central and Southern Appalachians into the
Mid-Atlantic through Wednesday.
 
2. In areas that experienced damage and power loss, individuals
should use extreme caution during the recovery phase.  Post-storm
fatalities and injuries often result from heart attacks, heat
exhaustion, accidents related to clean up and recovery, and carbon
monoxide poisoning from improper generator use.

<title>Tropical Storm Kate Forecast Discussion Number 11</title>

Tropical Storm Kate Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL102021
500 PM AST Mon Aug 30 2021
 
The low-level center of Kate is exposed in visible satellite imagery
this afternoon. Its deep convection collapsed late this morning, and
the sheared tropical cyclone is now only producing a small area of
convection over 60 n mi east of its center. A partial 1321 UTC
ASCAT-B pass still showed numerous 30-kt wind vectors in the eastern
semicircle, even with little to no active convection. The initial
intensity is conservatively lowered to 35 kt for this advisory.
 
The subtropical jet stream across the central Atlantic will continue
to impart strong west-northwesterly vertical wind shear on Kate
during the next day or so. If the struggling tropical cyclone can
survive these hostile conditions, some modest strengthening could
occur later this week over warm SSTs of 28 deg C or so. However, the
lack of mid-level moisture in the surrounding environment may limit
convective development even under these more favorable conditions,
and there is no guarantee that Kate will survive that long. In fact,
simulated satellite imagery from the GFS and ECMWF suggest that Kate
may continue to only produce sporadic bursts of convection over the
next couple of days, which jeopardizes its chances of surviving
through the week. The official NHC intensity forecast has been
adjusted downward based on the latest guidance trends and the
uncertainties discussed above. Minor fluctuations in intensity could
occur over the next 24-36 h as convective pulsing causes the
cyclone's intensity to hover around tropical-storm-force strength.
 
Kate is moving a little faster toward the north, or 355/9 kt, within
a weakness in the subtropical ridge. A northward motion is expected
to continue through early Tuesday. The subtropical ridge is expected
to become reestablished over the central Atlantic Tuesday night into
Wednesday, which should turn Kate toward the northwest through
midweek. Thereafter, Kate is forecast to accelerate northward or
north-northeastward ahead of an approaching deep-layer trough that
will move across the western Atlantic late this week. Assuming Kate
is still around by day 5, the cyclone is forecast to become absorbed
by a larger extratropical low near Atlantic Canada.
