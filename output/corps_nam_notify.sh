This is an automated message from the ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS)
running on ${HOSTNAME}.

This message is to let you know that the ASGS has been ACTIVATED and is using
the North American Mesoscale (NAM) model for meteorological forcing. Results
will be produced using the $GRIDFILE grid. 

You will continue to receive email from the ASGS on $HOSTNAME
as the results become available.

This is an automated message from the ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS)
running on ${HOSTNAME}.

The supercomputer $HOSTNAME has detected a new NAM cycle
(number $ADVISORY) from the National Centers for Environmental
Prediction (NCEP). The forcing data have been downloaded; ADCIRC surge
calculations are about to begin, using the $GRIDFILE grid. 

You will receive another email from the ASGS on $HOSTNAME
as soon as the resulting storm surge guidance becomes available.

This is an automated message from the ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS)
running on ${HOSTNAME}.

The supercomputer $HOSTNAME has produced ADCIRC results for 
NAM cycle $ADVISORY on the $GRIDFILE grid.

These results can be found at the following web site:

http://www.seahorsecoastal.com/ASGS/NAM/$GRIDFILE/$HOSTNAME/0.25DegreeResolution/$ADVISORY

The results consist of two archive files; the first contains hydrographs and 
wind speed plots at selected locations as well as the raw data that were
used to produce the plots, and the second contains contour plots of maximum 
surge elevation in GIS, Google Earth, and JPG format.

The ASGS on $HOSTNAME is now waiting for the National Centers for 
Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to issue the next cycle.
