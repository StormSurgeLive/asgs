This is an automated message from the ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS) running on ${HOSTNAME}.

This message is to let you know that the ASGS has been ACTIVATED for $STORMCLASSNAME ${YEAR} on the $GRIDFILE grd.  The ASGS was activated on $HOSTNAME because the storm is forecast to impact the Texas Coast.

The supercomputer $HOSTNAME has downloaded a hurricane forecast from the National Hurricane Center, and is performing calculations with SWAN+ADCIRC to predict the storm surge and wind speed along the complete Texas Coast as well as Galveston Bay.

You will receive an email from the ASGS on $HOSTNAME as soon as the results of this guidance become available. You will also continue to receive storm surge guidance for each forecast that the NHC issues for this storm, until the storm has passed through Texas.

This is an automated message from the ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS) running on ${HOSTNAME}.

The supercomputer $HOSTNAME has detected a new advisory (number $ADVISORY) from the National Hurricane Center for $STORMCLASSNAME ${YEAR}. This advisory has been downloaded; SWAN+ADCIRC wave and storm surge calculations are about to begin on the $GRIDFILE mesh. 

You will receive another email from the ASGS on $HOSTNAME as soon as the resulting storm surge guidance becomes available.

You may also receive emails notifying you of the detection of advisory $ADVISORY for storm $STORM from ASGS instances that are running on supercomputers OTHER THAN ${HOSTNAME}. The other instances are running for redundancy purposes.

This is an automated message from the ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS) running on ${HOSTNAME}.

The supercomputer $HOSTNAME has produced SWAN+ADCIRC results for storm surge guidance for advisory $ADVISORY for $STORMCLASSNAME $YEAR on the $GRIDFILE mesh. 

The results have been posted on Corral:

The ASGS on $HOSTNAME is now waiting for the National Hurricane Center to issue the next advisory.
