This is an automated message from the ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS)
running on ${HOSTNAME}.

This message is to let you know that the ASGS has been ACTIVATED and is using
the North American Mesoscale (NAM) model for meteorological forcing. Results
will be produced using the $GRIDFILE grid. 

You will continue to receive email from the ASGS on $HOSTNAME
as the results become available.

This is an automated message from the ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS)
running on ${HOSTNAME}.

The supercomputer $HOSTNAME has detected a new NAM cycle
(number $ADVISORY) from the National Centers for Environmental
Prediction (NCEP). The forcing data have been downloaded; ADCIRC surge
calculations are about to begin, using the $GRIDFILE grid. 

You will receive another email from the ASGS on $HOSTNAME
as soon as the resulting storm surge guidance becomes available.
