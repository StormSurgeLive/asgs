This directory contains the source code for "actoshape", a
program for generating shapefiles from ADCIRC output files.  Actoshape
is a shell script which is intended to be invoked from the command
line; it is a wrapper for a java program that is contained in the file
"actoshape.jar".  Java must be installed on your system (version 1.5
or higher) in order for actoshape to work.

To compile actoshape, type "ant".  Note that the file "actoshape",
located in this directory, is actually a shell script.  The normal
way to run the java program is to run the shell script, which takes
care of setting the classpath for you.  You should be able to run
"actoshape" from this directory immediately after compiling.

Documentation is in the file "actoshape.man", which is created
by ant when you compile the project.

Actoshape comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.  It is Free Software
and may be used under the terms of the RENCI Open Source Software
License, a copy of which is available in the file LICENSE.txt.

If you use actoshape in your project or publication, please
give credit to the author.

If you have questions or comments about actoshape, feel free
to contact me.
