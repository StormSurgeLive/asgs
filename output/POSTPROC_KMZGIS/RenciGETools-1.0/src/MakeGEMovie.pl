Usage: 

MakeGEMovie.pl  --dataFile=fort.63 --grid=gridName --prefix=prefix 
                --nLevels=nLevels --startDate=startDate --firstStep=firstStep 
                --nSteps=nSteps --stepInterval=stepInterval [--outputDir=dir]
                [--fort63Mode=mode] [--colorRange=colorRange] [--units=units]

This function reads an ADCIRC fort.63 formatted file and converts it into 
a GoogleEarth KMZ file.  It does this using a combination of Fortran, C and sh 
script codes. Each timestep of the fort.63 file is visualized individually.
Because we are using GMT to produce the plots, you have to have the GMT
versions of the grid on which the fort.63 files were produced. See the file
TiledREADME.pdf in this directory for details on how to make these.

The arguments are

    --dataFile:  The name of the fort.63 file to visualize.
    --fort63Mode: Supported modes are:

        full: The data values are contained in the fort.63 formatted 
              file specified by the --dataFile parameter.  All nodes are
              represented in the file. The nodes composing the grid 
              are contained in the file specified by the --gridFile parameter

        compact: The data values are contained in the fort.63 formatted
                 file specified by the --dataFile parameter.  Nodes without 
                 valid data are not represented in the file. The nodes composing
                 the grid are contained in the file specified by the --gridFile 
                 parameter.

        netCDFScoop: the grid and value data are in a netCDF file that 
                     conforms to that used in the ADCIRC implementation of 
                     the SURA Coastal Ocean Observing and Prediction (SCOOP) 
                     Program.
    --grid: the name of the gmt versions of the relevant ADCIRC grid.
    --prefix: the prefix for the resulting KMZ file.
    --nLevels: the number of levels of plots in the KMZ files. See 
               TiledREADME.pdf for more details.
    --startDate: the starting date of the simulation being visualized. This
                 is in yyyymmddhhmmss format.
    --firstStep: the first timestep of the simulation to be visualized.
    --nSteps: the number of timesteps of the simulation to be visualized.
    --stepInterval: the intervals of the steps to be visualized: 1 means
                    visualize every step, 2 means every other step ...
    --outputDir: the directory in which to deposit the artifacts.
    --colorRange: The colon seperated min max values to use for the colormap. 
                  For example --colorRange 0:2 will produce a colormap 
                  between 0 and 2 units.
    --units: The units for the display.  Must be either M for meters or
             FT for feet. Default is M.

Note that this call depends on the value of the environment var PPDIR.
Set it to the dir that contains the executables...
