Usage: 

makeWorldFile.pl  --image=imageFile --world=worldFile --east=east 
               --west=west --north=north --south=south 

This function reads a graphics file and creates a "world" file suitable for
ditributing the graphics file in a mapserver or similar environment.

The arguments are

    --image:  The name of the image file for which to create the worldfile.
    --world:  The world file to produce.
    --east:   The eastern extent of the image file.
    --west:   The western extent of the image file.
    --north:  The northern extent of the image file.
    --south:  The southern extent of the image file.

Note that this call depends on the value of the environment var PPDIR.
Set it to the dir that contains the executables...
