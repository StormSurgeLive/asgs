This is an automated message from the ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS)
running on ${HOSTNAME}.

This message is to let you know that the ASGS has been ACTIVATED for 
$STORMCLASSNAME ${YEAR} on the $GRIDFILE grd. 

The ASGS was activated on $HOSTNAME because 
the storm is forecast to pass within 270 nautical miles of southern Louisiana
at some point in its track. The supercomputer $HOSTNAME 
has downloaded a hurricane forecast from the National Hurricane Center, 
and is performing calculations with ADCIRC to provide storm surge guidance 
for the Louisiana coast and the greater New Orleans metro area.

You will receive an email from the ASGS on $HOSTNAME
as soon as the results of this guidance become available. You will also 
continue to receive storm surge guidance for each forecast that the NHC
issues for this storm, until the storm has passed to the north of the
northern Gulf Coast.

This is an automated message from the ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS)
running on ${HOSTNAME}.

The supercomputer $HOSTNAME has detected a new advisory
(number $ADVISORY) from the National Hurricane Center for
$STORMCLASSNAME ${YEAR}. This advisory has been downloaded; ADCIRC
storm surge calculations are about to begin on the $GRIDFILE 
grid. 

You will receive another email from the ASGS on $HOSTNAME
as soon as the resulting storm surge guidance becomes available.

You may also receive emails notifying you of the detection of 
advisory $ADVISORY for storm $STORM from ASGS instances 
that are running on supercomputers OTHER THAN ${HOSTNAME}. 
The other instances are running for redundancy purposes.

This is an automated message from the ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS)
running on ${HOSTNAME}.

The supercomputer $HOSTNAME has produced ADCIRC results for 
storm surge guidance for advisory $ADVISORY for $STORMCLASSNAME $YEAR
on the $GRIDFILE grid. 

These results can be found at the following web site:

http://www.seahorsecoastal.com/ASGS/${STORMNAME}${YEAR}/$GRIDFILE/$HOSTNAME/$ENSTORM/advisory_$ADVISORY

The results consist of two archive files; the first contains hydrographs and 
wind speed plots at selected locations as well as the raw data that were
used to produce the plots, and the second contains contour plots of maximum 
surge elevation in GIS, Google Earth, and JPG format.

The ASGS on $HOSTNAME is now waiting for the National Hurricane Center to
issue the next advisory.
