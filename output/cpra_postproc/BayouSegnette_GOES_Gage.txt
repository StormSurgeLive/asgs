Scott and Matt,
After our recent discussion about the gage outage at the Bayou Segnette Flood Side gage (82742) during TS Gordon, I spoke to the local levee authority about getting the gage operational again.

During this coordination with the locals we discussed that Rivergages.com has a gage, Bayou Segnette at Lapalco (82740) which follows very closely to and is very near the Bayou Segnette (82742) gage.  

Please keep this in the back of your mind as a consideration if we run into a gage outage again at Bayou Segnette (82742).

Thank you,
Stephen
