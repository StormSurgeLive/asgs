1. FigureGen must be built with netCDF support; otherwise, you will get the
following error:

FATAL ERROR: FigureGen has not been compiled to be compatible
             with NetCDF files.  Please use something like:

pgf90 FigureGen.F90 -DNETCDF -I$TACC_NETCDF_INC -L$TACC_NETCDF_LIB -lnetcdf

The makefile can be invoked as follows:

make all compiler=intel MACHINENAME=hatteras NETCDF=enable
