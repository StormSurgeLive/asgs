The ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS) is a software system
for generating storm surge and wave guidance from SWAN+ADCIRC
in real time on high-resolution meshes.  The ASGS constructs
meteorological forcing from a parametric wind/pressure model
using storm parameters extracted from National Hurricane Center
(NHC) Forecast Advisories.  This meteorological forcing is then
applied to simulations of waves and circulation by SWAN+ADCIRC
during storm events.  More information about the validation of
SWAN+ADCIRC in the northern Gulf is available here:

This specific application of the ASGS utilizes a mesh with
relatively low levels of resolution in the eastern Gulf,
and thus it does not include the necessary resolution
to provide high-fidelity  simulations of waves and surge
on the continental shelf and in the coastal floodplains
of the eastern Gulf.  Instead, these results should 
be used only to consider the storm's large-scale effects
on the eastern Gulf.  The providers do not guarantee the accuracy
of these results, especially in the nearshore.
