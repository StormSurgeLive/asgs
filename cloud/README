Basic Instructions - subject to major changes

Assumption: You're on a Linux or MacOS as the HOST machine and
in a terminal window. You also have access to the `git` utility.
These instructions do not apply to Windows, which is not supported
here at this time (thought Vagrant and Virtual Box certainly do
support Windows). We may add Windows instructions at a later time,
but the general steps should still conceptually work.

1. install VirtualBox onto your local laptop or workstation

  https://virtualbox.org

2. install Vagrant onto your local laptop or workstation

  https://www.vagrantup.com

3. ON HOST machine (laptop):

  % cd $HOME
  % git clone https://github.com/jasonfleming/asgs.git
  % cd $HOME/asgs/cloud/bento-ubuntu-18.10
  % git checkout master 
  % vagrant up
  % vagrant ssh                                  # this will place you on the virtual machine as user "vagrant"

NOTE: "bento" refers to official Vagrant base images found at

  https://app.vagrantup.com/bento

in this case we're using the image available at

  https://app.vagrantup.com/bento/boxes/ubuntu-18.10

4. ON GUEST machine (vm), initialize ASGS on the virtual machine, download
   and build padcirc, adcirc, adcprep, adcpost, padcswan, and adcswan

  $ bash $HOME/init-asgs.sh                      # this file is in $HOME (compiles all Fortran in ./asgs, perlbrew, and latest perl [1, 2]
  $ . $HOME/.bash_profile                        # source's perlbrew rc file, sets perl the one we want [2]
  $ bash $HOME/init-adcirc.sh                    # will prompt for Github username and password [3]

[1] NOTE: init-adcirc.sh pulls down asgs from GitHub (no credentials,
required), it also attempts to pull down adcirc-cg but it requires
your GitHub username/password AND access to the adcirc-cg repo.

[2] NOTE: the script used to install perlbrew, then to use perlbrew to
install the version of Perl we want is a little flaky. Feedback on
the user experience will help make it more robust.

[3] NOTE: the adcirc-cg repository is private and owned by the adcirc
github "organization". If you do not have access to it or the adcirc
source code, please contact the representatives listed at https:/adcirc.org.

More Information

Vagrant is a nice utility that allows one to manage headless virtual
machines on their laptops or work stations. Most use VirtualBox as the
VM hypervisor, but it supports a variety of platforms. It works by
starting with a vanilla base image (e.g., bento-ubuntu-18.10) and
provides a configuration file (Vagrantfile) where a user can define
how they want the virtual machine provisioned (set up).

The purpose of providing a set of Vagrant provisioning scripts inside
of this repo is to create a starting point for anyone wanting to run
or develop ASGS locally. In the future it might be the basis for
provisioning on actual cloud infrastructures (which Vagrant does
support).

Have fun!
