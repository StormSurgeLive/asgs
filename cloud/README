Basic Instructions - subject to major changes

1. install VirtualBox onto your local laptop or workstation
  https://virtualbox.org

2. install Vagrant onto your local laptop or workstation
  https://www.vagrantup.com

NOTE: "bento" refers to official Vagrant base images found at
  https://app.vagrantup.com/bento
in this case we're using the image available at
  https://app.vagrantup.com/bento/boxes/ubuntu-18.10

3. cd into the cloud directory
  % cd cloud/bento-ubuntu-18.10
  % vagrant up
  % vagrant ssh
  $ sh init-openmpi.sh && sh init-adcirc.sh  # RUN FIRST TIME ONLY

NOTE: init-adcirc.sh pulls down asgs from GitHub (no credentials,
required), it also attempts to pull down adcirc-cg but it requires
your GitHub username/password AND access to the adcirc-cg repo.

More Information

Vagrant is a nice utility that allows one to manage headless virtual
machines on their laptops or work stations. Most use VirtualBox as the
VM hypervisor, but it supports a variety of platforms. It works by
starting with a vanilla base image (e.g., bento-ubuntu-18.10) and
provides a configuration file (Vagrantfile) where a user can define
how they want the virtual machine provisioned (set up).

The purpose of providing a set of Vagrant provisioning scripts inside
of this repo is to create a starting point for anyone wanting to run
or develop ASGS locally. In the future it might be the basis for
provisioning on actual cloud infrastructures (which Vagrant does
support).

Have fun!
