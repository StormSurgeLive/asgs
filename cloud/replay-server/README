The Dockerfile included sets up an anonymous ftp using the
vsftp daemon. It is based on the Dockerfile for vsftp via
https://github.com/fauria/docker-vsftpd.

Summary:

Provided in this directory are the files needed to set up ftp and
web services that mimic what is provided for by the NHC when issuing
the advisories during a tropical event that ASGS uses to trigger new
simulations. It is meant primarily to facilitate pre-season drills
and is a work in progress.

Assumptions:

1. Docker has been set up on publicly accessible server running vsftpd
   and nginx (Ubuntu running on Digital Ocean with public IP address works
   great)
2. a user named "user" has been set up
3. the following directories exist:

  /home/user/rss-data       # docroot used by nginx container (location of index-at.xml RSS file)
  /home/user/data           # root ftp directory mapped to /var/ftp on the vsftpd container
  /home/user/data/atcf      # beginning of NHC-like directory structure
  /home/user/data/atcf/btk  # location of "best track" data files and index-at.xml RSS file
  /home/user/data/atcf/afst # location of forecast data file

Setting up Services:

Currently there is no container provided at Docker hub, so the image for
vsftpd must be created locally:

  docker build -t vsftpd/anonymous .

  Note: there is no need to build the nginx container since it uses the one
  that is already available via Docker Hub

Once this is done, there are 2 start scripts for the vsftpd and nginx servers:

  ./start-ftp.sh

  ./start-www.sh

The commands they contain are:

  # starting vsftpd (port 21, passive mode, anonymous ftp, NOT writeable)

  docker run -d -p 20:20 -p 21:21 -p 21100-21110:21100-21110 --restart always -v /home/user/data:/var/ftp:ro vsftpd/anonymous 

  # starting nginx (port 80)

  docker -v /home/user/data/rss-data:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro --restart always -d nginx

Rotating Forecasts:

There is a script in development to facilitate this, but it's a work in progress. The
above information provides a good basis to start if one wishes to facilitte their
own storm replaying.
