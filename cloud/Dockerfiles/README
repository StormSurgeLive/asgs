I. Introduction-

NOTE- The "official" Docker image for ASGS is based on the latest
"debian-stable" Docker image on Dockerhub.

It is located in the "debian-stable" directory, and is non-graphical.
Using Ubuntu base image should work just the same, this will give most
humans wanting a linux desktop, just that. However, we assume that ASGS
will be installed and run on a remote cluster headnode. It is still
appropriate to use this official Docker ASGS image on any host that
has a Docker client, like Windows, Mac, or some flavor of Linux.

The intention is publish regularly a "release" version of the
ASGS Docker image with the environment already installed. Until
this becomes part of a continuous integration workflow on our
Github space, it may be necessary to build the latest image locally.

I. Host Set Up

0. Prerequisites for the host machine (your laptop, head-node, or cloud VPS)-

# assumes Linux, the ability to build an image is unknown

a. install docker, set up per OS instructions
b. install docker-compose

II. Building the latest Docker image

# step 1 - build the image

  cd debian-stable;
  make build        # go do something else, this will take a while

# step 2 - run it (uses docker-compose)

  docker-compose up -d
  docker-compose exec -it asgs-debian asgsh
