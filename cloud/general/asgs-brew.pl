The ASGS shell has been updated.

Quick Start:

   $file

Recommended Start:

Adding the following line to your $asgs_home/.bash_profile file to preserve
the change on subsequent logins:

   export PATH=\$PATH:$asgs_home_bin

Source it:

   . $asgs_home/.bash_profile

Then run the shell:

   asgsh

If you didn't optionally build ADCIRC, the you can do so using the guided
utility available under asgsh, 'initadcirc'

NOTE:
Once this is run, you may assume the above environment is available. This
can be tested by making sure the exected binaries are in your path, for
example, `which ncdump` should find the utility in $asgs_install_path/bin

To report bugs or request enhancements, please file them at

   https://github.com/jasonfleming/asgs/milestone/19

Happy ASGS'ing.

=head1 NAME

asgs-brew.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is handles building all necessary libraries and utilities that
are required for a functioning local ASGS environment. It can be extended
by registering makefiles, scripts, or pure commands in the C<get_steps>
subroutine. Steps are processed in the order that they appear.

A useful interactive shell wrapper is installed upon successful completion
of all steps. See the L<ASGS INTERACTIVE SHELL> section below.

=head2 Note on script dependencies

It is very intentional that this script doesn't require anything other than
core Perl libraries that are readily available in any environment that perl
is also available.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Options generally reflect those values that are passed on to the various
makefiles:

    ./asgs-brew.pl --machinename <MachineName> --compiler <CompilerFamily> [--install-path some/path --home /path/other/than/user/$HOME --force]

Note: C<--install-path> defaults to $HOME/opt.

There is also a "clean" mode that will invoke the C<clean> for any
step that defines it:

    ./asgs-brew.pl --clean

=head1 OPTIONS

Options translate loosely to the options that are required directly in the
commands that each step requires, and they can be added quite easily to
accomodate new pieces of information.  Below is a summary of what's been
added so far.

=head2 Required

Not including any of these options when calling C<asgs-brew.pl> will cause
termination of the script before any processing is done.

=over 3

=item C<--asgs-profile> ProfileName

Provides a globally unique name to the environment created by C<asgs-brew.pl>
so that an operator may manage more than one ASGS installation. This option
will overwrite profiles of the same name without warning. The ASGS Shell
(C<asgsh>) is installed in only one location for all profiles. It looks for
the profile named, C<default>, to load whenever it is started.

=item C<--compiler> intel|gfortran

This option allows one to define the compiler family or group, as it is
typically passed to makefiles used by ASGS. The two most common values
for this flag are going to be C<gfortran> and C<intel>.  The step is not
required to use this value. It is merely passed along so that the C<command>
string may have access to the value if it is needed.

This value is set in the environment as C<ASGS_COMPILER>.

=item C<--machinename> MachineName

This option allows one to define the C<machine> name, which is a common
value that is used in typical ASGS makefiles. It is made available for use
when defining a step. The name of the machine must be consistent with what
is in the ASGS C<platforms.sh> file and ADCIRC's C<cmplrmk.flags> file,
otherwise you will see weird issues.

This value is set in the environment as C<ASGS_MACHINE_NAME>.

=back

=head2 Additional Options

=over 3

=item C<--adcirc-git-branch> BranchTagOrSHA

This option allows the operator installing ASGS to select a specific branch,
tag, or commit hash to C<checkout> before an attempt is made to build
ADCIRC from the source. It's passed directly to a C<git checkout> command,
so valid values are determined entirely by what this C<git> command accepts.

The default value of "." (dot) is meant to indicate that there will be no
attempt to `git checkout` to the custom value (could be branch, tag, or
commit hash as stated in the paragraph above).

=item C<--adcirc-git-url> RemoteGitRepoURL

Specify the remote ADCIRC repository url; also known as a C<fork>. This is really
only useful for development activities, therefore by default it is set to
the official ADCIRC repository URL on GitHub:

L<https://github.com/adcirc>

=item C<--adcirc-git-repo>

Specify the name of the repo. The default is C<adcirc-cg>, which at the time
of this writing is the name of the official repository on GitHub. Chances
are very small that option needs to be changed from the default value.

=item C<--adcirc-dir> /path/to/adcirc/dir

Used in conjunction with the C<adcirc> build step. C<asgs-brew.pl> looks
here for the ADCIRC source code to build. The environmental variable,
C<ADCIRCDIR> is set using this path and will persist in the C<ASGS Shell>
where it is affects where C<asgs_main.sh> looks for the ADCIRC binaries.
This also adds C<ADCIRCBASE> and C<SWANDIR>.

=item C<--clean>

For each step, only the C<clean> (if defined) is run and then the
script quits. The purpose of this is to provide access to the the C<clean>
target that makefiles generally provide, but any command can be specificed
in the step definition.

=item C<--force>

Forcibly runs all steps, in order.

Using this option overrides any C<skip_if> conditions found in any step; it
also overrides both C<--skip-steps> and C<--run-steps>, if either has been
provided as part of the command.

=item C<--home> /path/to/alt/home

The default is set to the effective user's actual home directory, which is
the value that the environmental variable C<$HOME> is typically assigned. As
with the C<--compiler> flag, this value may or may not be used to define
some part of a step. This value also replaces the environment's HOME value
before any default paths are set (e.g., if C<--install-path> is not specified)
or any steps are executed. Anything depending on the effective user's HOME
environmental variable will see this value. This is useful when installing
ASGS from the C<$WORK> directory.

This value is set in the environment as C<ASGS_HOME>, in addition to the
traditional C<HOME> if C<--replace-home> is set.

NOTE: Unintended consequences may arise in a user's C<ASGS Shell> environment
if C<HOME> is changed.

=item C<--replace-home>

If used in conjunction with the C<--home> flag, replaces the effective user's
HOME directory variable in the environment used throughout C<asgs-brew.pl> and
provided in the ASGS Shell. This may cause unexpected results since a lot of
things outside of ASGS rely on the C<$HOME> variable and make the assumption
that it points to the effective user's actual home directory as defined in
in the system's C</etc/passwd>.

=item C<--install-path> /path/to/install/dir

Equivalent to config's C<--prefix> option, available for use as the main parent
directory under which to pass to scripts, makefiles, and other commands as
the intended home for all of the utilities you wish to rehome.

This value is set in the environment as C<ASGS_INSTALL_PATH>.

=item C<--make-jobs> Integer

Provides a way to specify the the level of concurrency one may use with
a makefile when defining the command in a step. Some makefiles are not
properly able to use this option, so it is optionally used when defining
the step command itself.

=item C<--debug>

Provides debugging output for various options.

=item C<--update-shell>

This option is provided as a way to update the C<ASGS Shell> without executing
any of the steps. 

=back

=head2 Options for C<run steps>

Flags are provided to query the current set of run steps and to run selected
steps, either by defining which steps to not run (C<--skip-steps>) or by defining
only the steps to run (C<--run-steps>). Both cases are useful almost entirely
for debugging purposes and are not generally recommends for operators installing
ASGS on well supported systems.

=over 3

=item C<--list-steps>

Prints a nice listing of each step's key (in order of execution) and the
description. It then exits, doing nothing else. It's handy when using
C<--skip-steps> since this option takes a list of keys to skip.

=item C<--skip-steps> C<step1, step2, step3, ...>

This flag is for really for debugging so that one may target a specific step,
it is not meant for the general run case of building up the ASGS environment;
asgs-brew.pl is meant to be run fully. It accepts a comma delimited list
of run step keys (no spaces) to skip. For example, if one wished to skip
the C<perl>, C<openmpi>, and C<hdf5-netcdf> steps and begin with the
C<wgrib2> step - but continue through the rest of the list, the flag would
be specificed as,

   --skip-steps=perl,openmpi,hdf5-netcdf

To get the list of keys, use the C<--list-steps> option. This option is not
compaitble with C<--run-steps>. C<--force> overrides it.

=item C<--run-steps> C<step1, step2, step3, ...>

This flag is for really for debugging so that one may target a specific step,
it is not meant for the general run case of building up the ASGS environment;
asgs-brew.pl is meant to be run fully. It accepts a comma delimited list
of run step keys (no spaces) to run. For example, if one wished to run
the C<perl>, C<openmpi>, and C<hdf5-netcdf> steps, then the flag would be
specified as,

   --run-steps=openmpi,hdf5-netcdf,perl-modules

To get the list of keys, use the C<--list-steps> option. This option is not
compatibale with C<--skip-steps>. C<--force> overrides it.

NOTE: run order is defined by how each step is defined internally, not by
the order in which they are passed to C<--run-steps>.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION

When a Perl script is executed, it stores the user's environmental variables
(e.g., the output of the C<env> command) into a global hash, %ENV. This
script makes a local copy of that hash so that it may use and modify it as
each step requires.  Each step may define a set of environmental variables it
wishes to set and make available for subsequent steps. Once %ENV is updated,
all subsequent perl commands and spawned subshells will have access to the
modified %ENV. For example, when a Perl script runs a system command using the
backticks (e.g., `some command from the shell`), the environmental variables
and their values are governed by the %ENV global variable.

When a step builds a library that is a dependency for subsequent steps,
it is a good idea to leverage the C<export_ENV> key for each step to define
the variable and what it's new value should be.

A good example is the step that builds the NETCDF and HDF5 libraries, utlized
extensively by any utility that must read or modify ADCIRC output files,
hot start files, or external forcing data. Therefore, before the step is
executed, the following variables are among those updated in %ENV:

=over 3

=item LD_LIBRARY_PATH

=item LD_INCLUDE_PATH

=item PATH

=back

=head2 Exporting The Environment

asgs-brew.pl doesn't automatically update the user's environment as it exists
after all steps have been run successfully. Since there is the ability to
export environmental variables in each step (available for the current and
subsequent steps), it might be desired to be able to recreate this post-run.

For ease of use, a wrapper around the native bash shell is installed called
C<asgsh>. Instructions on starting this shell environment are output at the
end of a successful installation. Included in this environment are a set of
ASGS specific commands and the full environment as it existed at the end.

Documentation of the ASGS Shell is contained as a help section in the shell
itself. The C<--update-shell> option may be used with C<asgs-brew.pl> to
update to the latest version of this shell environment without have to run
each step.

There is also additional information in the C<ASGS INTERACTIVE SHELL> section
below.

=head1 ADDING AND MANAGING STEPS

When adding a new step, it is important to consider where in the order of
steps it should appear. If it's a library used by many utilities (e.g.,
NetCDF or HDF5), additional care must be made when specifying the step -
in particular the environmental variables that is standard for compilers
utilize, such as C<LD_INCLUDE_PATH> or C<LD_LIBRARY_PATH>.

NOTE: The best way to learn about the structure of a step is to inspect the
source code of C<asgs-brew.pl>. What follows is a reference, but doesn't give
as clear of a picture as viewing the actual implementation details.

The defined C<keys> to define when adding a step are as follow,

=over 3

=item C<key>

Unique key that is meant to unambiguously refer to the step in options
that may accept a list of steps. For example, it's required for using the
C<--list-steps> flag.

=item C<description>

Provides a fair, short summary of the step. Required for the C<--list-steps>
flag to act appropriately.

=item C<name>

Short name for the step, doesn't have to be unique across steps and runs,
but it's good to make sure that the name is short and informative.

=item C<pwd>

The directory specified is the one from where the step's C<command> should
be run.

=item C<command>

This is the primary command is run in the current step unless the C<--clean>
flag is specified. Options are passed from the commandline of asgs-brew.pl to
the C<$opts_ref> hash reference by using the C<Getops::Long> options definition
in the C<run> subroutine.  Options can be added easily to the arguments list
of asgs-brew.pl, but the general rule of thumb should be that the options be
kept to a minimum. Most of the complexity associated with a step should be
hidden within the step's makefile, script, or program supporting the command.

A command can either be a string, which is evaluated using the C<system> command;
or it can be an anonymous Perl subroutine. In this case, when the reference is
called it will be pased a reference of the step's fully defined hash and
all options and tracked internal information that is tracked in the code with
the C<$opts_ref> varable (inspect asgs-brew.pl's code to see this).

=item C<export_ENV>

Environmental variables affect a great number of things in this space, so it
is important to be able to manage them as each step completes. Each step may
define any number of environmental variables and how they should be updated.

Below is an example used for the C<hdf5-netcdf> step. This example demonstrates
which variables to update, with what value, and how.

    export_ENV => {
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH => { value => qq{$asgs_install_path/lib},     how => q{prepend} },
	LD_INCLUDE_PATH => { value => qq{$asgs_install_path/include}, how => q{prepend} },
	NETCDFHOME      => { value => qq{$asgs_install_path},         how => q{replace} },
    },

Options for C<how> include: C<prepend> (default if not defined), C<append>,
and C<replace>.

=item C<clean>

Defines the command used to C<clean> a directory tree. As with C<command>, this
can be either a string or a subroutine reference. See C<command> information
above for more details.

=item C<skip_if>

Defines the condition on which the run step can be skipped. This check can
be bypassed if the C<--force> flag is passed. It is similar in nature to the
C<postcondition_check> or C<precondition_check>, but has been separated out
for the purpose of selectively ignoring a run step if desired. This check
happens BEFORE C<precondition_check>.

=item C<precondition_check>

If this method is private, it is run before C<command>. If it fails, then
appropriate action should be taken to fix that.

=item C<postcondition_check>

If this method is private, it is run after C<command>. If it fails, then
appropriate.

=head2 A Note about Interdependency Among Steps

This script has no means of enforcing dependency among scripts, but this
can be added if needed in the future. The steps are executed serially, but
there is no limit to the concurrency that each individiual step can have -
for example, C<make> is very good at concurrently running independent portions
of the makefile if it is set up correctly (and by using the C<-j> option).

It is assumed that each step MUST complete successfully, and this is why there
is a C<postcondition_check> method that can be customized to ensure that
the expected state after the step is complete has been satisfied. Failure
of this method at any step will result in the script stopping. Similarly,
each step is able to also define a C<precondition_check> that also must be
evaluate positively if the step itself is to be attempted.

=head1 ASGS INTERACTIVE SHELL

A successful completion of the running of this script installs an interactive
shell environment that makes available all environmental updates made by the
steps. The shell also provides some convenient ASGS specific commands that
make running and operating ASGS easier. Commands will be added as needed. To
read more about the shell, please read the C<README.asgsh>.
