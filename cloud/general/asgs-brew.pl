=head1 NAME

asgs-brew.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is handles building all necessary libraries and utilities that are required for
a functioning local ASGS environment. It can be extended by registering makefiles, scripts,
or pure commands in the C<get_steps> subroutine. Steps are processed in the order that they appear.

=head2 Note on script dependencies

It is very intentional that this script doesn't require anything other than core Perl libraries
that are readily available in any environment that perl is also available.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Options generally reflect those values that are passed on to the various makefiles:

    ./asgs-brew.pl --machinename <MachineName> --compiler <CompilerFamily> [--install-path some/path --home /path/other/than/user/$HOME --force]

Note: C<--install-path> defaults to $HOME/opt.

There is also a "clean" mode that will invoke the C<clean_command> for any step that defines it:

    ./asgs-brew.pl --clean

=head1 OPTIONS

Options translate loosely to the options that are required directly in the commands that each
step requires, and they can be added quite easily to accomodate new pieces of information.
Below is a summary of what's been added so far.

=over 3

=item C<--clean>

For each step, only the C<clean_command> (if defined) is run and then the script quits. The
purpose of this is to provide access to the the C<clean> target that makefiles generally
provide, but any command can be specificed in the step definition.

=item C<--compiler>

This option allows one to define the compiler family or group, as it is typically passed to
makefiles used by ASGS. The two most common values for this flag are going to be C<gfortran>
and C<intel>.  The step is not required to use this value. It is merely passed along so that
the C<command> string may have access to the value if it is needed.

=item C<--debug-skip-steps>

This flag is for debugging only so that one may target a specific step, it is not meant for
the general run case of building up the ASGS environment. It accepts a comma delimited list
of run step keys (no spaces) to skip. For example, if one wished to skip the C<perlbrew>,
C<openmpi>, and C<hdf5-netcdf> steps and begin with the C<wgrib2> step - but continue through
the rest of the list, the flag would be specificed as,

   --debug-skip-steps=perlbrew,openmpi,hdf5-netcdf

To get the list of keys, use the C<--list-keys> option.

=item C<--dump-env>

Runs through each step, but only sets up the environment that is specified (if it is specified).
It then prints to STDOUT the list of variables and their values in a way that is suitable to be
used in a bash script.

=item C<--force>

If used, the C<skip_if> defined for a step (if defined) is not run. C<--debug-skip-steps> is
checked before C<--force> and therefore overrides it.

=item C<--home>

The default is set to the effective user's actual home directory, which is the value that the
environmental variable $HOME is typically assigned. As with the C<--compiler> flag, this value
may or may not be used to define some part of a step.

=item C<--install-path>

Equivalent to config's C<--prefix> option, available for use as the main parent directory under
which to pass to scripts, makefiles, and other commands as the intended home for all of the
utilities you wish to rehome.

=item C<--list-steps>

Prints a nice listing of each step's key (in order of execution) and the description. It then
exits, doing nothing else. It's handy when using C<--debug-skip-steps> since this option takes
a list of keys to skip.

=item C<--machinename>

This option allows one to define the C<machine> name, which is a common value that is used in
typical ASGS makefiles. It is made available for use when defining a step.

=item C<--make-jobs>

Provides a way to specify the the level of concurrency one may use with a makefile when defining
the command in a step. Some makefiles are not properly able to use this option, so it is optionally
used when defining the step command itself.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT AND CONFIGURATION

When a Perl script is executed, it stores the user's environmental variables (e.g., the
output of the C<env> command) into a global hash, %ENV. This script makes a local copy
of that hash so that it may use and modify it as each step requires.  Each step may define
a set of environmental variables it wishes to set and make available for subsequent
steps. Once %ENV is updated, all subsequent perl commands and spawned subshells will
have access to the modified %ENV. For example, when a Perl script runs a system command
using the backticks (e.g., `some command from the shell`), the environmental variables
and their values are governed by the %ENV global variable.

When a step builds a library that is a dependency for subsequent steps, it is a good
idea to leverage the C<export_ENV> key for each step to define the variable and what
it's new value should be.

A good example is the step that builds the NETCDF and HDF5 libraries, utlized extensively
by any utility that must read or modify ADCIRC output files, hot start files, or
external forcing data. Therefore, before the step is executed, the following variables
are updated in %ENV:

=over 3

=item LD_LIBRARY_PATH

=item LD_INCLUDE_PATH

=item PATH           

=back

=head2 Exporting The Environment

asgs-brew.pl doesn't automatically update the user's environment as it exists after
all steps have been run successfully. Since there is the ability to export environmental
variables in each step (available for the current and subsequent steps), it might be desired
to be able to recreate this post-run.  To get a dump of the variables set, how they are
set, one may use the C<dump-env> option. Adding this to the set of options provided at
build time will produce the update variables as they appear at the end of a fully successful
running of all steps. 

=head1 ADDING AND MANAGING STEPS 

When adding a new step, it is important to consider where in the order of steps
it should appear. If it's a library used by many utilities (e.g., NetCDF or HDF5),
additional care must be made when specifying the step - in particular the
environmental variables that is standard for compilers utilize, such as C<LD_INCLUDE_PATH>
or C<LD_LIBRARY_PATH>.

The defined C<keys> to define when adding a step are as follow,

=over 3

=item C<key>

Unique key that is meant to unambiguously refer to the step in options that may accept
a list of steps. For example, it's required for using the C<--list-steps> flag.

=item C<description>

Provides a fair, short summary of the step. Required for the C<--list-steps> flag to
act appropriately.

=item C<name>

Short name for the step, doesn't have to be unique across steps and runs, but it's good
to make sure that the name is short and informative.

=item C<pwd>

The directory specified is the one from where the step's C<command> should be run.

=item C<command>

This is the primary command is run in the current step unless the C<--clean> flag
is specified. Options are passed from the commandline of asgs-brew.pl to the C<$opts_ref>
hash reference by using the C<Getops::Long> options definition in the C<run> subroutine.
Options can be added easily to the arguments list of asgs-brew.pl, but the general rule
of thumb should be that the options be kept to a minimum. Most of the complexity associated
with a step should be hidden within the step's makefile, script, or program supporting
the command.

=item C<export_ENV>

Environmental variables affect a great number of things in this space, so it is important
to be able to manage them as each step completes. Each step may define any number of environmental
variables and how they should be updated. 

Below is an example used for the C<hdf5-netcdf> step. This example demonstrates which variables
to update, with what value, and how.

    export_ENV => {
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH => { value => qq{$install_path/lib},     how => q{prepend} },
	LD_INCLUDE_PATH => { value => qq{$install_path/include}, how => q{prepend} },
	NETCDFHOME      => { value => qq{$install_path},         how => q{replace} },
    },

Options for C<how> include: C<prepend> (default if not defined), C<append>, and C<replace>.

=item C<clean_command> 

Defines the command used to C<clean> a directory tree.

=item C<skip_if>

Defines the condition on which the run step can be skipped. This check can be bypassed
if the C<--force> flag is passed. It is similar in nature to the C<postcondition_check>
or C<precondition_check>, but has been separated out for the purpose of selectively
ignoring a run step if desired. This check happens BEFORE C<precondition_check>.

=item C<precondition_check>

If this method is private, it is run before C<command>. If it fails, then appropriate
action should be taken to fix that.

=item C<postcondition_check>

If this method is private, it is run after C<command>. If it fails, then appropriate.

=back

=head2 A Note about Interdependency Among Steps

This script has no means of enforcing dependency among scripts, but this can be added
if needed in the future. The steps are executed serially, but there is no limit to the
concurrency that each individiual step can have - for example, C<make> is very good at
concurrently running independent portions of the makefile if it is set up correctly
(and by using the C<-j> option).

It is assumed that each step MUST complete successfully, and this is why there is a
C<postcondition_check> method that can be customized to ensure that the expected
state after the step is complete has been satisfied. Failure of this method at any
step will result in the script stopping. Similarly, each step is able to also define
a C<precondition_check> that also must be evaluate positively if the step itself is
to be attempted.
