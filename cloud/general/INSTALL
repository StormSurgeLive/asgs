I. Automated Building and "Installing" of ASGS

There is a script that is going to support a single command to build the
required environment for ASGS on all platforms.

        cd $HOME
        git clone https://github.com/jasonfleming/asgs.git
	cd ./asgs
        git checkout master # or whatever branch you're going to be using
	perl ./cloud/general/asgs-brew.pl --compiler=intel --machinename=<name-used-in-makefiles> --install-path=$HOME/opt

*Note: the "perl" used to run asgs-brew.pl can be the system perl. The script
doesn't use any modules that are not part of the perl core set.

When this command is issued (be sure to use the machine's "name" as it is in
the various makefiles), it runs through a series of steps that go through
and build required libraries (e.g., HDF/NetCDF, OpenMPI - if gfortran is
specified as the compiler, etc). It also builds internal Fortran based tools
spread throughout the asgs directory. The script also build the expected
Perl environment using the "perlbrew" tool.

NOTE: This script doesn't do anything for the set up of an ASGS ADCIRC
model run

II. Getting More Information

The script itself contains quite a bit of documentation. It's written in Perl,
so the "perldoc" command can be used to render the internal documentatin
that is contained inside of the script.

	perldoc ./cloud/general/asgs-brew.pl

III. What To Do After asgs-brew.pl Is Run

Run the ASGS Shell,

       $HOME/opt/bin/asgsh

Then type, 'help', to get started. More information is also available in
README.asgsh.
