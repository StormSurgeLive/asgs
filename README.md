The Automated Solution Generation System (ASGS) provides software infrastructure
for automating coastal ocean modelling for real time decision support, and provides
a variety of standalone command line tools _for_ pre and _post_-processing.

It includes `asgsh`, an extremely powerful interactive shell geared towards operational
storm surge forecasting, managing multiple ADCIRC installations, and facilitating ADCIRC
development workflows and testing.
