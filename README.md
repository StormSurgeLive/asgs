This is the RENCI fork of ASGS for instrumenting the code with RabbitMQ messaging and notes on porting to a new cluster, in this case Penguin On Demand resources. 

See ASGS_Setup.md for detailed "basic setup" notes, which are relevant for any new user.

See ASGS_RMQMessaging.md for enabling RMQ messsaging.
