# Take an ATCF formatted BEST track file and fill in the forecast
# increment (TAU in ATCF parlance) in hours according to the date/time
# column, starting at zero.
#
# The resulting file will be used as input to aswip and ultimately
# ADCIRC's NWS19.
#
# Also has the capability to time-interpolate the central pressure
# values from the BEST track data into an ADCIRC fort.22 for HWind
# data.
