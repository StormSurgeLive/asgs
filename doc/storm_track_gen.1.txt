storm_track_gen(1)
==================
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
storm_track_gen.pl - generates ATCF formatted input files for ADCIRC using a combination
of hindcast and forecast data. 

SYNOPSIS
--------
*storm_track_gen.pl* --dir 'PATH_TO_RAW_ATCF_FILES' --storm 'STORM_NUMBER' --year 'YEAR' [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The storm_track_gen.pl(1) program has three required command line arguments and 
six optional command line arguments. These command line arguments are listed below.

OPTIONS
-------

*--dir* 'PATH_TO_RAW_ATCF_FILES'::
    Find the raw ATCF input files in the directory 'PATH_TO_RAW_ATCF_FILES'. This 
    command line argument is required.

*--storm* 'STORM_NUMBER'::
    Use 'STORM_NUMBER' as the storm number in the year specified by the *--year* option
    below. This is used in constructing the names of the input files. This command line
    argument is required.

*--year* 'YEAR'::
    Use the four digit year 'YEAR' when constructing the names of the input files. 
    This command line argument is required. 

*--coldstartdate* 'CS_DATE_TIME'::
    Parse the number string 'CS_DATE_TIME' to determine the year, month, day, and hour
    corresponding to the ADCIRC cold start time. The number string is ten characters 
    in the format +YYYYMMDDHH24+. This is used to relate the dates and times listed
    in the ATCF data with the current state of the ADCIRC simulation. If it is not
    supplied, the script assumes that the very first line in the hindcast ATCF file
    corresponds to the ADCIRC cold start date and time. 

*--hotstartseconds* 'ADCIRC_MODEL_TIME'::
    Use number of seconds 'ADCIRC_MODEL_TIME' as an offset to the cold start date and
    time to determine the date and time corresponding to the current ADCIRC model time
    if the model is to be hotstarted. 

*--nws* 'NWS'::
    Generate an ATCF formatted file suitable for use in ADCIRC's internal vortex 
    model specified by the NWS value 'NWS'. See documentation for ADCIRC's fort.15
    file for details of the NWS parameter. Possible values are 19 or 319.

*--name* 'VARIATION'::
    Vary the output data using according to the string 'VARIATION'. Allowable 
    values are 'maxWindSpeed', 'overlandSpeed', and 'veer'. The output data will
    have the corresponding values adjusted as described below. 

*--percent* 'PERCENT'::
    When varying the output data using the *--name* option above, use 'PERCENT'
    as the magnitude of the variation, as described below. 


.Definitions

maxWindSpeed;;
   The Vmax in the output data will be adjusted using the percentage indicated
with the *--percent* command line option; for example, the use of this
variation with a percent value of 110 will increase all Vmax values in the
forecast portion of the output by 10%.  If these data are subsequently used in
the aswip program, that program will calculate the Rmax values based on the
modified Vmax. 

overlandSpeed;;
   The forecast times in the output data will be adjusted using the percentage
indicated with the *--percent* command line option; for example, the use of 
this variation with a percent value of 110 will reduce all forecast times in
the output by 10%.

veer;;
   The storm coordinates in the output data will be adjusted using the percentage
indicated with the *--percent* command line option; for example, the use of
this variation with a percent value of 100 will cause the storm to veer to the right
along the right edge of the consensus track; setting the percent value to -100
will cause the storm to veer to the left along the left edge of the consensus track.
