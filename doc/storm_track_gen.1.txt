NAME
----
storm_track_gen.pl - generates ATCF formatted input files for ADCIRC using a combination
of hindcast and forecast data. 

SYNOPSIS
--------
*storm_track_gen.pl* --dir 'PATH_TO_RAW_ATCF_FILES' --storm 'STORM_NUMBER' --year 'YEAR' [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The storm_track_gen.pl(1) program has three required command line arguments and 
six optional command line arguments. These command line arguments are listed below.

OPTIONS
-------

*--dir* 'PATH_TO_RAW_ATCF_FILES'::
    Find the raw ATCF input files in the directory 'PATH_TO_RAW_ATCF_FILES'. This 
    command line argument is required.

*--storm* 'STORM_NUMBER'::
    Use 'STORM_NUMBER' as the storm number in the year specified by the *--year* option
    below (the NHC numbers each tropical cyclone of the season). This is used in 
    constructing the names of the input files. This command line argument is required.

*--year* 'YEAR'::
    Use the four digit year 'YEAR' when constructing the names of the input files. 
    This command line argument is required. 

*--coldstartdate* 'CS_DATE_TIME'::
    Parse the number string 'CS_DATE_TIME' to determine the year, month, day, and hour
    corresponding to the ADCIRC cold start time. The number string is ten characters 
    in the format +YYYYMMDDHH24+. This is used to relate the dates and times listed
    in the ATCF data with the current state of the ADCIRC simulation. If it is not
    supplied, the script assumes that the very first line in the hindcast ATCF file
    corresponds to the ADCIRC cold start date and time. 

*--hotstartseconds* 'ADCIRC_MODEL_TIME'::
    Use number of seconds 'ADCIRC_MODEL_TIME' as an offset to the cold start date and
    time to determine the date and time corresponding to the current ADCIRC model time
    if the model is to be hotstarted. If this command line
    argument is not given, the script assumes a cold start (i.e., that
    hotstartseconds is zero). 

*--nws* 'NWS'::
    Generate an ATCF formatted file suitable for use in ADCIRC's internal vortex 
    model specified by the NWS value 'NWS'. See documentation for ADCIRC's fort.15
    file for details of the NWS parameter. Possible values are 19 or 319.

*--name* 'VARIATION'::
    Vary the output data using according to the string 'VARIATION'. Allowable 
    values are 'maxWindSpeed', 'overlandSpeed', and 'veer'. The output data will
    have the corresponding values adjusted as described below. Only one --name
    argument is allowed per execution.

*--percent* 'PERCENT'::
    When varying the output data using the *--name* option above, use 'PERCENT'
    as the magnitude of the variation, as described below. The default
    percentage variation is 20 percent for maxWindSpeed, -20 percent for
    overland speed, and 100 percent for veer. 


.Definitions

maxWindSpeed;;
   The Vmax in the output data will be adjusted using the percentage indicated
with the *--percent* command line option; for example, the use of this
variation with a percent value of 110 will increase all Vmax values in the
forecast portion of the output by 10%.  If these data are subsequently used in
the aswip program, that program will calculate the Rmax values based on the
modified Vmax. 

overlandSpeed;;
   The forecast times in the output data will be adjusted using the percentage
indicated with the *--percent* command line option; for example, the use of 
this variation with a percent value of 110 will reduce all forecast times in
the output by 10%.

veer;;
   The storm coordinates in the output data will be adjusted using the percentage
indicated with the *--percent* command line option; for example, the use of
this variation with a percent value of 100 will cause the storm to veer to the right
along the right edge of the consensus track; setting the percent value to -100
will cause the storm to veer to the left along the left edge of the consensus track.

DISCUSSION
----------

The script storm_track_gen.pl accepts a raw ATCF-format hindcast file (straight
from the NHC ftp site) and a raw ATCF-format forecast file (either straight
from the NHC ftp site or formed by some other method, e.g., parsed from a text
advisory). It produces a fort.22 file for ADCIRC for the NWS=9 (asymmetric wind
vortex model) option.

Selecting the right hindcast or forecast line to start with based on the
coldstart time and hotstart seconds, and filling in the date, time, and
forecast periods correctly on the following lines requires the bulk of the code
in the script. Most of the complexity is due to the fact that ADCIRC may be
required to start at a point in time that may be somewhere in the hindcast or
forecast, depending on the circumstance. Also, it is possible to have a
hindcast file that has a later end date than the start date in the forecast
file. Creating the storm variations requires a comparatively small amount of
code.

In addition to filling in the required forecast period, filling in the date
in the forecast portion of the file, and performing the requested variation,
the script modifies the data from the NHC in three other ways:

1. The background pressure is changed to 1013 mb.

2. The wind radii, which are required by the asymmetric vortex model (ADCIRC's
NWS=9), are filled in if they are missing. These fields are populated according
to the following procedure: (a) if the wind radius in any of the four quadrants
is zero, that quadrant's radius will be filled in with the average of the
nonzero radii at that point in time; (b) if all the radii are zero, they will
all be set equal to the correpsonding values from the previous time level; (c)
if there are no values from the previous time level, they will be set to the
then-current hindcast Rmax in the case of a hindcast line, or to the nowcast
Rmax in the case of a forecast line.

3. The central pressure is filled in according to an experimental algorithm
under development by Jason Fleming. This algorithm uses a family of negatively
sloped lines that relate changes in central pressure to changes in max wind
speed. This algorithm is being refined for storms in the Gulf. It is a topic of
current research and is targeted for publication. As such, it is subject to
change and improvement over the course of the season.

The script assumes that the files are named bal[storm][year].dat and
al[storm][year].fst. For example, the first tropical cyclone in the Atlantic
basin in 2009 will have files named bal012009.dat and al012009.fst.

At the beginning of the script's source code, additional technical assumptions
are listed that may be of interest.
