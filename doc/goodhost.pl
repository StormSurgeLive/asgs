# Input to goodhost.pl is a series of log files that contain
# the list of hosts involved in successful jobs, as well as 
# a separate list of log files containing the list of hosts
# involved in failed jobs. 
#
# goodhost.pl then assigns each host a score, based on its
# participation in successful or unsuccessful jobs. Each time
# a host is involved in a successful job, its score is incremented
# by 1. Each time it is involved in a failed job, its score is 
# decremented by 1.
#
# Hosts with the highest final score are least likely to be 
# causing issues, while those with the lowest final scores are most
# likely to be problem hosts.
