*Release notes for 2019stable*

Introduced a quick start script (./init-asgs.sh) that guides new users through an
installation interactively. It calls a new tool, asgs-brew.pl, that automaticaly
builds and installs all required untilities. It provides an interactive shell
called asgsh (asgs shell) that provides the environment required to
operate ASGS. Included in this shell environment are a small set of
initial custom commands that are meant to aid operators and developers
working with ASGS. Supported platforms include all of thoses listed in
./platforms.sh along with capabilities of provisioning a virtual machine
with ASGS installed for testing and learning purposes. In future releases,
we will introduce the ability to run ASGS locally using a virtual machine on
a user's local laptop or workstation. For more information on a quick start,
please review installation directions in ./INSTALLING.

Incompatibilities with existing installations:

The Perl module, Date::Pcalc has been replaced with Date::Calc. In order to use
this latest stable version of ASGS, a user must ensure that Date::Calc is installed.
The newly provided initialization and installation toolchain installs this module, but
for existing ASGS installations one may wish to install this module manually and
ensure it's available to perl.

Other

Added support for using Amazon's SES (simple email service) to send emails for
enhanced reliability over using the local environment's sendmail.

Recommended Update Steps for using init-asgs.sh or asgs-brew.pl

We recommend that a user keeps (or backs up) their old ASGS installation intact
and install this version anew. Basic steps: 1) rename old asgs director, 2) checkout
asgs's 2019stable branch from Github, 3) run ./init-asgs.sh, 4) follow the instructions
output. Please report bugs or request enhancements at
