NAME
----
generateCPP.f90 - Insert the CPP (carte parallelogrammatique projection) 
into an ADCIRC netcdf output file, leaving the existing coordinates intact.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*generateCPP.x* --datafile 'ADCIRC_FILE_NAME'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The +generateCPP.f90(1)+ program calculates the CPP projection of a set of
geographic coordinates found in an ADCIRC netcdf output file and inserts the
projected coordinates into the netcdf file (leaving the existing geographic
coordinates intact and unaffected). This can be helpful in generating
visualizations. The variable names of the new coordinates are 'x_cpp' and
'y_cpp'.

OPTIONS
-------

*--datafile* 'ADCIRC_FILE_NAME'::
    Use the netcdf formatted ADCIRC output file named 'ADCIRC_FILE_NAME' when
    calcuating and writing the CPP projection.
    
*--cpp* 'SLAM0' 'SFEA0'::
    Use the values 'SLAM0' and 'SFEA0' as the longitude (degrees, 
    -180.0 to 180.0) and latitude (-80.0 to 80.0), respectively,
    of the center of the 
    cpp projection.
