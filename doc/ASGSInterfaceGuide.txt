Executive Summary
-----------------

The ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS) provides real time output 
from the ADCIRC or ADCIRC+SWAN models for analysis and 
interpretation by downstream applications. An interface 
specification is an invaluable tool that facilitates reliable 
coordination between the ASGS and downstream applications while 
enabling independent development processes. 

As a result, this guide was created as a living document to detail 
the interface contract the ASGS and its downstream applications. 
This contract consists of the following three components: (1) the 
run.properties files for each forecast ensemble member; (2) the 
opendap server configuration; and (3) the format of the results files 
themselves. 

Not all downstream applications will rely on every aspect of the 
interface described herein. Rather, each downstream application will 
use only a subset of this specification. However, all instances of 
the ASGS are required to adhere to all aspects of specification in 
order to provide assurance of compatibility to all downstream 
application developers.

Run Properties
--------------

A run.properties file is produced for each forecast ensemble run 
from the ASGS, and placed in the same results directory as the output
files for the forecast run. 

A sample of the run.properties file is shown below, organized into 
document subsections according to the nature of various properties.
Definitions of these properties will be added later.

The following properties describe the type of input that was used to
generate the results.

HPC Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following properties provide data about the High Performance 
Computing (HPC) resources that were involved in the production of 
results, which may be used in troubleshooting or performance analysis.

    directory storm : /projects/ncfs/data/asgs15784/10/nhcConsensus
    hostname : hatteras.renci.org
    instance : corpsbackup3
    forecastEnsembleMemberNumber : 0
    cpurequest : 480
    ncpu : 480
    numwriters : 0

OPeNDAP Service
---------------

OPeNDAP is the middleware between the ASGS instance that is 
generating results and any downstream applications that provide 
further analysis and visualization. As such, the configuration 
details of this service are critical to reliable compatibility with 
downstream applications. 

There are three subcomponents to the setup of OPeNDAP for ASGS: (1) 
the XML configuration file for the server; (2) the directory 
hierarchy used to post the results; and (3) the catalog generation 
script. Each of these aspects are described more fully in the 
following sections.

OPeNDAP Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The server itself runs inside Tomcat and has an XML configuration file
whose content we will specify in this section.

Directory Hierarchy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The results files from the ASGS are posted in a particular directory 
hierarchy that enables us to have multiple instances of the ASGS on
multiple machines producing results for multiple ensemble members on 
multiple meshes. The details of this directory hierarchy are specified
in this section.

Catalog
~~~~~~~

RENCI has developed an automated cataloging script whose configuration
and operation will be briefly described here with pointers to relevant
publications containing further details. The contents of the resulting
catalogs and their pertinence to downstream applications will also be
provided here.

Output Files
------------

The output files from the ASGS should be compressed NetCDF4, 
produced according to CF standards, including a time stamp showing 
the cold start date. This section can also describe any particular
piece of NetCDF metadata that must be included for compatibility with 
downstream applications.

Climate and Forecast Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description of the relevant parts of the CF standards that must
be implemented in the ADCIRC and ADCIRC+SWAN NetCDF4 output files
for compatibility with downstream applications.

NetCDF Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any other key pieces of NetCDF metadata that are used by downstream
applications and must be provided for compatibility.
