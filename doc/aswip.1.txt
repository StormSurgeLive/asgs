NAME
----
aswip - asymmetric vortex preprocessing and analysis code for ADCIRC

SYNOPSIS
--------
*aswip* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The aswip(1) command reads an ADCIRC fort.22 file for the HWind format
(NWS=15 in the ADCIRC fort.15) or an ATCF formatted BEST track file with the hours column filled
in as described for the dynamic asymmetric vortex model (NWS=19 in the ADCIRC fort.15)
In the case of ATCF formatted input, it generates an output file suitable for
use in the asymmetric vortex model in ADCIRC. It can also perform vortex wind
field analyses as described below.

OPTIONS
-------

*-a, -A*::
    Calculate Rmax as a function of azimuthal angle in increments
    of 1 degree and output the data to file(s) called full_circle_rmaxes_xxx.d.

*-v, -V*::
    Calculate wind velocity and barometric pressure along five storm radii:
    northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest, and the radius that is
    clockwise perpendicular to storm motion. Radial resolution is half
    a nautical mile. Output the data to file(s) called radialvp_xxx.d.

*-s, -S*::
    Calculate wind velocity and barometric pressure on an unstructured
    mesh, which defaults to a circular mesh consisting only of points,
    with no element table. However, an element table will be included
    in the output file if a suitable table has been specified with the '-e'
    option. The radial spatial resolution is
    1 nautical mile and azimuthal resolution is 5 nautical miles.
    The data are output to VTK-formatted file(s) called spatial_data_xxx.d
    (VTK stands for Visualization ToolKit, a free visualization package
    from Kitware, Inc.). These files can be loaded directly into VTK
    (http://www.vtk.org) or Paraview (http://www.paraview.org) for
    visualization and further analysis.

*-d, -D*::
    Suppress writing of the asymmetric vortex output file (NWS_19_fort.22).

*-e, -E* 'ELEMENT_TABLE_FILE'::
    Use the element table in the file 'ELEMENT_TABLE_FILE' to go along
    with the spatial wind velocity and barometric pressure data that are
    being generated as specified by the '-s' option. Inclusion of an
    element table enables the production of streamlines for visualization.

*-f, -F* 'FRAME_NUMBER'::
    Only perform wind analyses on the specified 'FRAME_NUMBER', that is,
    the snapshot found by incrementing into the data using either the timestep,
    if provided by the '-o' option. If the '-o' option was not given,
    each snapshot or time period in the raw data is considered a frame.

*-i, -I* 'MESH_FILE'::
    Generate spatial wind velocity and barometric pressures on the mesh
    in the file 'MESH_FILE'. This option requires that the 'MESH_FILE'
    be in the ADCIRC fort.14 file format.

*-m, -M* 'ISOTACH_SELECTION_METHOD'::
    Use 'ISOTACH_SELECTION_METHOD' to choose among isotachs when more than
    one has been provided for a particular quadrant at a particular point
    in time. The selected isotach will be used for calculation of Rmax
    at the center of that storm quadrant at that point in time. Possible
    values of 'ISOTACH_SELECTION_METHOD' are 1, meaning that the 34kt
    isotach should always be used; or 2, meaning that the highest isotach
    should always be used.

*-o, -O* 'TIME_INCREMENT'::
    Use 'TIME_INCREMENT' (in seconds) when performing wind analyses. If
    this option is not used, and wind analyses were requested using other
    options, the time increment defaults to the time resolution of the underlying
    data. If the time resolution of the underlying data varies, output will
    simply be generated at each time that data are available.

*-n, -N* 'NWS'::
    The input fort.22 file is set up in the format required for the
    ADCIRC wind model corresponding to the 'NWS' value. The NWS values
    15 and 19 are supported. If 'NWS' is set to 19, the fort.22 is expected
    to be in ATCF format with the hours column set to monotonically increasing
    values, and an input file will be generated for ADCIRC's asymmetric vortex
    model. If 'NWS' is set to 15 (HWind), only wind analysis features are supported.

*-p, -P* 'PERCENT_RMAX'::
    Enlarge or reduce the radius to maximum winds that have been calculated
    for the asymmetric vortex by the amount specified by 'PERCENT_RMAX'.

*-x, -X* 'PERCENT_VMAX'::
    Intensify or weaken the maximum wind speed from the ATCF formatted
    input file by the amount specified by 'PERCENT_VMAX'.

*-t, -T* 'TIME_OFFSET'::
    Use the 'TIME_OFFSET' value (in seconds) to correspond to the first
    data in the input file, rather than setting the first data to correspond
    to time=0.

*-r, -R* 'RMAX'::
    Set all the radius to maximum wind values to the specified value
    in the NWS_19_fort.22 asymmetric vortex file for use in ADCIRC.

*-w, -W* 'FILE_TO_PROCESS'::
    Use the file name 'FILE_TO_PROCESS' as the input file for processing;
    the default is 'fort.22' if this option is not specified.

DEPENDENCIES
------------
Aswip is distributed with the ADCIRC source code and requires that several
ADCIRC modules be available during compilation.

Aswip was originally created by Robert Weaver and Rick Luettich.
Jason Fleming reorganized it for modularity and brevity and added
the meteorological analysis features. This man page was written by
