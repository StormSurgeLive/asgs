NAME
----
adcprep - domain decomposition for the coastal circulation and storm surge model ADCIRC

SYNOPSIS
--------
*adcprep* --np 'NUM_SUBDOMAINS' ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The adcprep(1) program has optional command line arguments, listed below. 

OPTIONS
-------

The capability of adcprep to use command line options was developed to
ease the task of automating its execution. If the adcprep command is issued
without command line options, it will present an interactive menu to 
the user to allow the selection of the task to be performed. 

*--np* 'NUM_SUBDOMAINS'::
    Decompose the domain into 'NUM_SUBDOMAINS' subdomains. The number of subdomains
    should be equal to the number of compute processors that will be used in the
    parallel computation. This command line option is required.

*--partmesh*::
    Partition the mesh only; that is, decide which subdomain each of the nodes
    should fall into. This should be done first. The result is a file called
    +partmesh.txt+, which consists of a list of integers, one line per node
    in the fulldomain mesh. Each integer in the list represents the subdomain
    number that each node will fall into. As a result, the range of values
    in the file represents the range of subdomain numbers. 

*--prepall*::
    Use the +partmesh.txt+ file to decompose all the ADCIRC input files into
    subdirectories numbered 'PExxxx' where 'xxxx' is the zero indexed, zero 
    padded subdomain number. Expects all input files to have the default names,
    e.g., the mesh file must be named +fort.14+ instead of something like 
    +myMeshFile.grd+ in order for this option to work. This option requires
    that adcprep has already been executed with the *partmesh* option, and that
    the +partmesh.txt+ file was written successfully.    

*--prep13*::
    Only redecompose the nodal attributes (fort.13) input file. Requires that
    *prepall* step has already been performed.

*--prep15*::
    Only redecompose the control model parameter and periodic boundary conditions
    file (fort.15) input file. Requires that *prepall* step has already been performed.

*--prep20*::
    Only redecompose the non-periodic, normal flux boundary condition file (fort.20).
    Requires that *prepall* step has already been performed.

*--prep88*::
    Only redecompose the upland river initialization file (fort.88).
    Requires that *prepall* step has already been performed.
