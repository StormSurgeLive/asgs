NAME
----
adcirc - coastal circulation and storm surge model

SYNOPSIS
--------
*adcirc* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The adcirc(1) program has optional command line arguments, listed below. 

OPTIONS
-------

*-I* 'INPUTDIR'::
    Look for input files in the directory 'INPUTDIR' instead
    of looking in the directory where the ADCIRC command was issued. 

*-O* 'GLOBALDIR'::
    Write fulldomain output files to the directory 'GLOBALDIR' instead
    of writing them to the directory where the ADCIRC command was issued.  

*-L*::
    When running in parallel, write subdomain output and binary hotstart files
    to the PE* subdirectories instead of writing fulldomain output and 
    binary hotstart files. This option does not affect the writing of NetCDF hotstart files,
    which are always written for the full domain.

*-S*:: 
    When running in parallel, write subdomain binary hotstart files
    to the PE* subdirectories instead of writing fulldomain binary 
    hotstart files. This option does not affect the writing of NetCDF hotstart file,
    which are always written for the full domain.
 
*-R*::
    When running in parallel, read subdomain binary hotstart files
    instead of a fulldomain binary hotstart file. This option does not
    affect the reading of NetCDF hotstart files, which always reflect
    the fulldomain solution. 

*-W* 'NUM_WRITERS'::
    When running in parallel, dedicate 'NUM_WRITERS' MPI processes  
    solely to the task of writing ascii output files (either sparse or dense ascii 
    formats). Must be a positive integer. This option only affects the 
    writing of the ascii formatted fort.63, fort.64, fort.73, and fort.74 files.

*-Ws* 'NUM_SPLIT_WRITERS'::
    Same as *-W* option above, but a new file is created each time the data
    are written; the integer part of the simulation time is appended to the
    file name. 

*-H* 'NUM_HOTSTART_WRITERS'::
    Same as *-W* option above, except that 'NUM_HOTSTART_WRITERS' MPI processes
    will be dedicated to writing binary hotstart files. This option does
    not affect the writing of NetCDF hotstart files. The binary hotstart files
    that are written using this option are only suitable for 2DDI runs without
    harmonic analysis. 

*-M*::
    When running in parallel, write subdomain harmonic analysis files.
    This option is useful for tidal analyses with many consituents (e.g.,
    more than approximately 30) because writing fulldomain harmonic 
    analysis output files with this many constituents can exhaust the 
    physical memory of the host computer. 
    
*-Mft* 'MESH_FILE_TYPE'::
    The 'MESH_FILE_TYPE' can be specified as 'ascii' (the default) or
    'xdmf' (introduced in ADCIRC v51).
    
*-Mfn* 'MESH_FILE_NAME'::
    Search for a full domain mesh file named 'MESH_FILE_NAME' rather than
    the default mesh file name 'fort.14'.
    
*-Nft* 'NODAL_ATTRIBUTES_FILE_TYPE'::
    The 'NODAL_ATTRIBUTES_FILE_TYPE' can be specified as 'ascii' (the default) or
    'xdmf' (introduced in ADCIRC v51).
    
*-Nfn* 'NODAL_ATTRIBUTES_FILE_NAME'::
    Search for a full domain nodal attributes file named 
    'NODAL_ATTRIBUTES_FILE_NAME' rather than the default nodal attributes 
    file name 'fort.14'.
