<h1>The ASGS Developers Guide</h1>
</div>
<div id="content">
<h2 id="_introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>This document describes the guidelines that ADCIRC Surge Guidance System
developers should use when developing new code for ASGS and its related
utilities. It also presents a short tutorial for Subversion (svn), the version
control software that we use to coordinate development and ease the task of
merging in new features.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_guided_tour">Guided Tour</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The following is a list of directories and files that are provided
with the ASGS along with a description of their purpose and function.</p></div>
<h3 id="_base">base</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The root of the ASGS directory structure contains the scripts that provide
the main features of the ASGS.</p></div>
<h4 id="_asgs_main_sh">asgs_main.sh</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The actual script that is executed to activate the ASGS is called asgs_main.sh.
Its main function is to perform a hindcast if needed, then move to a
nowcast/forecast loop. It contains code that controls the preparation of new
runs, sets up computational jobs, submits them, and monitors them. It also
contains a small section that contains conditionally executed system-specific
configuration information.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>All the code that actually does the specialized work, e.g., downloading
meteorological data, constructing control files, generating visualizations of
results, etc., is contained in modular external scripts.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The asgs_main.sh script is the most central and most important one in the
ASGS.</p></div>
<h4 id="_control_file_gen_pl">control_file_gen.pl</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The ADCIRC fort.15 and SWAN fort.26 (run control) files are generated by
control_file_gen.pl. This script accepts a wide array of input arguments that
describe the sort of run the Operator has configured, including the use of
tidal forcing, wave coupling, time step size, desired output file format (ascii
vs netcdf), and many others.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Other input arguments to this script provide state information, e.g., whether
the model is to be hotstarted, the current simulation time, the advisory
number from the latest National Hurricane Center Forecast/Advisory
(in the case of hurricane-related runs), etc.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When the script runs, it uses templates that have been made for the control
files along with the input arguments and a few external programs (for
generating tides, etc) and the already-generated meteorological forcing files
(if any) and produces control files for ADCIRC or ADCIRC+SWAN along with
metadata in the run.properties file.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is the 2nd most important script in the ASGS (after asgs_main.sh).</p></div>
<h4 id="_get_atcf_pl">get_atcf.pl</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The get_atcf.pl script is used by the ASGS to monitor the RSS feed from the
National Hurricane Center for new Forecast/Advisories and to download the
latest advisory the moment it becomes available. It does this by parsing the
xml file posted on the RSS feed, and when the advisory number has been updated
by the NHC, get_atcf.pl follows the link to the html file containing the actual
advisory information.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After downloading a new Forecast/Advisory from the National Hurricane Center
website, the script then downloads the latest hindcast (BEST track) file
for the same storm from NHC&#8217;s anonymous ftp site. Both these files are required
for generating an ADCIRC fort.22 (meteorological forcing) file.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once a forecast is complete, and the next advisory has not yet been posted, the
script waits 60 seconds before checking the RSS site again. It will continue
checking every 60 seconds until the next advisory is posted.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The script is called get_atcf.pl because the so-called BEST track file format
(that describes the files that the script downloads from the anonymous ftp
site) was designed by the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting system (ATCF).
Please see the section below that discusses the ADCIRC parametric vortex models
below for more details on this format, including a link to the online
documentation.</p></div>
<h4 id="_nhc_advisory_bot_pl">nhc_advisory_bot.pl</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The nhc_advisory_bot.pl script takes the html file downloaded by get_atcf.pl
script and parses out all the information required to write an ATCF formatted
forecast file ("OFCL"). It then generates the ATCF formatted file with the
forecast parameters; this file could be used directly by one of ADCIRC&#8217;s
internal parametric vortex models, but the ASGS subjects it to further
processing as described below.</p></div>
<h4 id="_storm_track_gen_pl">storm_track_gen.pl</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The storm_track_gen.pl script takes the ATCF-formatted file generated by
nhc_advisory_bot.pl (representing the forecast), the ATCF-formatted file
downloaded by get_atcf.pl (representing the hindcast), and the currrent
simulation state (representing the current hotstart time) and constructs an
appropriate ADCIRC fort.22 (meteorological forcing) file as output.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This script accepts optional arguments that can be used to vary the storm&#8217;s
track (expressed as a percentage of the desired distance between the consensus
track and the edge of the cone of uncertainty), the radius to maximum winds
(expressed as a percentage of the radius to maximum winds determined from the
input), the overland speed of the storm (to speed it up or slow it down), and
the maximum wind speed. These variations are configured in the overall ASGS
configuration file and can be used to explore "what-if" scenarios during a
tropical cyclone event.</p></div>
<h4 id="_get_nam_pl">get_nam.pl</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The get_nam.pl script is used by the ASGS to monitor NCEP&#8217;s anonymous ftp site
for newly released output from their NAM (North American Mesoscale) atmospheric
model. The WRF-NMM (Weather Research and Forecasting, Non-hydrostatic
Mesoscale Model) is used to produce NAM results.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The script accepts the current time of the ADCIRC simulation as input, and
downloads the latest available NAM data, provided that the latest available
data is later than the current ADCIRC simulation time. If there are no NAM data
available that postdate the current ADCIRC simulation time, the script print
and information message and exits. The calling routine (in asgs_main.sh) then
retries the download every 60 seconds until new data have been discovered and
downloaded.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The get_nam.pl script relies on the "wgrib2" executable to perform basic
sanity checks on the grib2 files that it downloads.</p></div>
<h4 id="_namtoowi_pl">NAMtoOWI.pl</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The NAM output files in grib2 format that were downloaded by get_nam.pl are
converted into a form that ADCIRC (or ADCIRC+SWAN) can use by the NAMtoOWI.pl
script. This script uses the wgrib2 utility to extract the sea level u, v, and
p from the NAM output files (in grib2 format) and produce ascii data files. The
ascii data are then reprojected from the NAM coordinate system (lambert
conformal) to the ADCIRC coordinate system (geographic) using the
awip_lambert_interp executable. A list of points must be provided where the
reprojected and interpolated data should be calculated. Finally, the
interpolated data are output in OWI (Ocean Weather Inc) format for use in
ADCIRC or ADCIRC+SWAN (NWS=12).</p></div>
<h4 id="_get_flux_pl">get_flux.pl</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If time-varying river flux boundary condition data (ADCIRC&#8217;s fort.20 file) are
available, and the ASGS has been configured to include river flux forcing, the
get_flux.pl script retrieves the boundary condition files and formats them for
use in ADCIRC. It must reads the ADCIRC mesh file to determine the number of
river flux boundary nodes so that it can interpret the data in the incoming
flux files, since the file format is not self describing. The script also takes
into account the current time in the ADCIRC simulation and the files that are
currently available on the remote ftp site when constructing the flux boundary
condition file that ADCIRC will actually use.</p></div>
<h4 id="_queue_script_generators">queue script generators</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The ASGS supports many HPC platforms, and it seems that each one is different
from the others and has its own idiosyncracies. As a result, there are a number
of queue script generation scripts, including erdc.pbs.pl, loadleveler.pl,
queenbee.pbs.pl, ranger.serial.pl, ranger.sge.pl, and tezpur.pbs.pl. Although
there are different scripts for different platforms, they are broadly similar,
in that they all use a template approach &#8230; a working queue script has
"blanks" inserted for parameters that will change for different simulation runs
and then a script is written (often cloned from one of the existing ones) that
simply fills in the blanks according to the command line arguments.</p></div>
<h3 id="_config">config</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The "config" subdirectory contains sample configuration files to illustrate
the changes to be made for various situations.</p></div>
<h4 id="_config_asgs_config_irene_garnet_ec95d_sh">config/asgs_config_irene_garnet_ec95d.sh</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is a sample configuration file that sets the ASGS up to run hurricane
Irene on the Garnet machine at ERDC using the small ec95d mesh.</p></div>
<h4 id="_config_asgs_config_irene_swan_garnet_r3_sh">config/asgs_config_irene_swan_garnet_r3.sh</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This sample configuration file illustrates the settings required for
the ASGS to run hurricane Irene with SWAN coupling on the Garnet machine
at USACE ERDC using the FEMA R3 mesh for the US mid-Atlantic coast.</p></div>
<h4 id="_config_asgs_config_irene_swan_river_br_ncv6b_sh">config/asgs_config_irene_swan_river_br_ncv6b.sh</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>During hurricane Irene, this sample configuration file was used in North
Carolina to run the ASGS on the Blueridge Dell linux cluster at RENCI with SWAN

<div class="paragraph"><p>README.storm_track_gen</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The script storm_track_gen.pl accepts a raw ATCF-format hindcast file (straight
from the NHC ftp site) and a raw ATCF-format forecast file (either straight
from the NHC ftp site or formed by some other method, e.g., parsed from a text
advisory). It produces a fort.22 file for ADCIRC for the NWS=9 (asymmetric wind
vortex model) option.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Examples showing the use of command line parameters are as follows:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>--dir /path/to/atcf/files : Required. This is used to provide the path to the
ATCF formatted hindcast and forecast files.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>--storm 01 : Required. The NHC numbers each tropical cyclone of the season, and
the storm number is required to determine the names of the input files.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>--year 2009 : Required. The year is used in the names of the input files as
well.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>--coldstartdate 2009090100 : Required. The asymmetric wind model assumes that
the first line in the fort.22 file is the one to be used when execution begins
(whether the start of execution represents a coldstart or a hotstart). As a
result, the correct line in the hindcast and forecast file must be selected to
reflect the desired cold start time (YYYYMMDDHH24).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>--hotstartseconds 86400.0 : Required if execution begins as a hotstart. Because
the asymmetric wind model within ADCIRC will always start at the top of the
fort.22 file at the beginning of execution, the fort.22 file must begin at the
date and time that matches the hotstart file, if any. If this command line
argument is not given, the script assumes a cold start (i.e., that
hotstartseconds is zero).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>--name nhcConsensus : Optional. If this argument is not given, the script
assumes that the fort.22 for the NHC consensus forecast should be generated.
Other possible variations include maxWindSpeed, overlandSpeed, and veer. In the
future, variation of rMax will be supported as well. Only one --name argument
is allowed per execution.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>--percent 50 : Optional. This argument controls the magnitude of variation for
the maxWindSpeed, overlandSpeed, and veer variations. For the maxWindSpeed and
overlandSpeed variations, a positive percentage increases the speed and a
negative percentage decreases the speed. For the veer variation, -100 percent
represents the left edge of the cone of uncertainty, and 100 percent represents
the right edge of the cone of uncertainty. The default percentage variation is
20 percent for maxWindSpeed, -20 percent for overland speed, and 100 percent
for veer.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Selecting the right hindcast or forecast line to start with based on the
coldstart time and hotstart seconds, and filling in the date, time, and
forecast periods correctly on the following lines requires the bulk of the code
in the script. Most of the complexity is due to the fact that ADCIRC may be
required to start anywhere in the hindcast and forecast, and it is possible to
have a hindcast that is later than the forecast. Creating the storm variations
requires a comparatively small amount of code.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In addition to filling in the required forecast period, filling in the date
in the forecast portion of the file, and performing the requested variation,
the script modifies the data from the NHC in three other ways:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
The background pressure is changed to 1013 mb.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The wind radii, which are required by the asymmetric vortex model, are
filled in if they are missing. These fields are populated according to the
following procedure: (a) if the wind radius in any of the four quadrants is
zero, that quadrant&#8217;s radius will be filled in with the average of the nonzero
radii at that point in time; (b) if all the radii are zero, they will all be
set equal to the correpsonding values from the previous time level; (c) if
there are no values from the previous time level, they will be set to the
then-current hindcast Rmax in the case of a hindcast line, or to the nowcast
Rmax in the case of a forecast line.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The central pressure is filled in according to an experimental algorithm
under development by Jason Fleming. This algorithm uses a family of negatively
sloped lines that relate changes in central pressure to changes in max wind
speed. This algorithm is being refined for storms in the Gulf. It is a topic of
current research and is targeted for publication. As such, it is subject to
change and improvement over the course of the season.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The script assumes that the files are named bal[storm][year].dat and
al[storm][year].fst. For example, the first tropical cyclone in the Atlantic
basin in 2009 will have files named bal012009.dat and al012009.fst.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>At the beginning of the script&#8217;s source code, additional technical assumptions
are listed that may be of interest.</p></div>
<h3 id="_original_asymmetric_vortex_wind_model_adcirc_nws_9">Original Asymmetric Vortex Wind Model (ADCIRC NWS=9)</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>jgf20090623: Correction: hour 0 in the fort.22 corresponds to the cold start
time (ADCIRC time=0) if the simulation is cold started, or to the hot start
time if the simulation is hotstarted.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>README.asymmetric (NWS=9 in fort.15)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The asymmetric vortex wind model input differs from most other types of wind
input in ADCIRC in that it consists of storm parameters, rather than the
meteorological data itself. ADCIRC then uses these parameters to generate the
actual meteorological data internally at each node at every time step during
the simulation. The result is that the fort.22 files are very small (e.g.
20kB), in comparison with fort.22 files that contain actual meteorological
data. Furthermore, preprocessing these files is very fast because it consists
only of copying the fort.22 file as-is to each subdomain directory.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The format of the fort.22 file for the asymmetric wind model is the ATCF
(a.k.a. "BEST track") format. This format was developed by the U.S. Navy, and
ATCF stands for Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast. Historical tracks,
real-time hindcast tracks and real-time forecast tracks may be found in this
format. The format is documented in detail at the following web site:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/atcf_web/docs/database/new/abrdeck.html">http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/atcf_web/docs/database/new/abrdeck.html</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One important thing to remember about this format is that it looks like CSV
data, but it is actually fixed column width data. Never change the width of the
columns when you edit this data!</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is assumed by the asymmetric wind code within ADCIRC that the first entry in
the fort.22 file corresponds to the cold start time (ADCIRC time=0) if the
simulation is cold started, or to the hotstart time if the simulation is
hotstarted. Therefore, the forecast period (column #6) needs to be edited by
the workflow scripts to reflect the time of the forecast/nowcast for each track
location (each line) in hours from the start of the simulation (0, 6, 12, 18,
etc). The original data in that column depends on what type of best track
format data is being used. The original data might have 0 or other numbers in
that column.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For more details on how to prepare the input files for the asymmetric wind
model, see the documentation in the ADCIRC manual under NWS=9:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="http://adcirc.org/documentv48/parameter_defs.html#NWS">http://adcirc.org/documentv48/parameter_defs.html#NWS</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Real time hindcast and forecast advisories are made available by the NHC in
ATCF format via their ftp site every six hours when there is an active tropical
cyclone. These files are downloaded by the workflow and used to generate
fort.22 files for ADCIRC.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Since NHC forecast advisories do not contain the radius of maximum winds, this
option uses the standard radii at specific wind speeds (34, 50, 64, 100 knots)
reported in the four quadrants (NE, SE, SW, NW) of the storm to calculate the
radius of maximum winds as a function of the azimuthal angle.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The asymmetric wind model is activated by setting NWS=9 in the fort.15 file and
adding a WTIMINC line in the appropriate place in this file. The WTIMINC line
is not used, but is maintained for file-format compatilbility with the
symmetric vortex wind model, and for possible future expansion.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The asymmetric vortex wind model was developed and coded by Craig Mattocks
(<a href="mailto:cmattock@email.unc.edu">cmattock@email.unc.edu</a>) and implemented in ADCIRC by Cristina Forbes

<h3 id="_what_if_asymmetric_vortex_wind_model_adcirc_nws_19">"What-if" Asymmetric Vortex Wind Model (ADCIRC NWS=19)</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>README.asymmetric2 (NWS=19 in fort.15)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The extended asymmetric vortex wind model is selected by setting NWS in the
ASGS configuration script to 19.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This wind model is based on the code that generates the original asymmetric
vortex wind data (NWS=9), and its behavior is similar in many ways to that
model. As a result, this documentation will focus mainly on the differences
between the two wind models.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The extended asymmetric vortex wind model was developed for several reasons:
(1) to allow more visibility into the parameters, such as Rmax, that control a
storm&#8217;s size and shape and are calculated within the wind model code; (2) to
allow the user to control parameters such as Rmax so that they may be adjusted
by the user; and (3) to allow the user to deterministically compensate for
input data that are missing or nonexistent (such as wind radii in various
quadrants for a particular isotach).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The mechanism for achieving the goals described above is a preprocessing
program called the asymmetric wind input preprocessor, or aswip, that
takes the ATCF formatted input data that would normally be used for the
NWS8 or NWS9 and adds columns to it that describe the following things:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
The Rmax from the hindcast (i.e., BEST lines) has been persisted from the
Rmax column (described as MRD in the ATCF documentation) from the value in the
forecast (i.e., OFCL lines).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The storm direction DIR and speed SPEED in the ATCF file have been replaced
with the calculated direction and speed to be used by ADCIRC. The values are
provided in the same format as the ATCF file to provide compatibility between
methods. The speed in given in knots and the direction is given in compass
coordinates, with zero degrees indicating North and values increasing
clockwise.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In the 2nd column after the storm name, the cycle number is provided. A
<em>cycle</em> is an entry or set of entries in the file that all have the same storm
time or forecast period.  For cycles that have more than one isotach, this
value will be repeated for each isotach (starting from 1 for the first cycle in
the file).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The 3rd column after the storm name contains the number of isotachs that are
reported for that particular cycle.  This value is also repeated on each line
for each isotach that is reported per cycle. For example, if the cycle has a
34kt and a 50kt isotach entry then this column will contain a <em>2</em> for both
entries in that cycle.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The following 4 columns contain the flags that tell the ADCIRC NWS 19 code
whether or not to use a particular wind radius from the isotach under
consideration. There is a flag for each quadrant. A <em>0</em> indicates that the wind
radius for that isotach and quadrant will not be used.  A <em>1</em> indicates that
the wind radius for that isotach and quadrant will be used.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example: if only the 34kt isotach is provided, then then all four wind
radii must be used, and the columns will all be set to <em>1</em> :
 &#8230; 34 &#8230; 1 1 1 1 1 &#8230;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Another example: if 3 isotachs are provided then the columns may look
like the following:
 &#8230; 34 &#8230; 3 0 0 0 0 &#8230;
 &#8230; 50 &#8230; 3 0 0 1 1 &#8230;
 &#8230; 64 &#8230; 3 1 1 0 0 &#8230;
this indicates -
 use NO radii from the 34 kt isotach
 use the 3 &amp; 4 quadrant radii from the 50 kt isotach
 use the 1 &amp; 2 quadrant radii from the 64 kt isotach</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Users could potentially modify these flags in the input file to manually select
which radii to use for each cycle.</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
In the next 4 columns, the calculated Rmax for each quadrant is listed
in the following order: NE SE SW NW.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The next column contains the overall Holland B value.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Finally, one valuable aspect of this file format is that it can be used by
NWS8, NWS9, or NWS19, since the original data have not been modified. The
extra columns are used as input by NWS19, and as a result, they provide both
metadata and control over these parameters.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_metadata_generation">Metadata Generation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>When the ASGS Workflow creates a fort.22 file, it is difficult to tell how that
file has been modified from the original, just by looking at it. The Workflow
(specifically, storm_track_gen.pl) is capable of generating variations in
track, overland speed, and maximum wind speed. Modifications to radius to max
wind will be provided for in a future ASGS release (beyond v1.2).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In order to clearly indicate whether the track has been varied, and if so, how
the track has been varied, two metadata mechanisms are provided. First, a file
with a fixed name, fort.22.meta, is created that contains a description of the
wind file. In addition, a symbolic link is made to the fort.22 file that
contains encoded information about the data in the file. These mechanisms will
now be described in turn.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The fort.22.meta file uses the <em>#</em> symbol to denote comments, so lines starting
with # are ignored. The other lines are key value pairs using the delimiter
<em>:</em>. Everything on one line before the first delimiter is considered to be the
key, everything after that until the end of the line (not including the
linebreak) is the value.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The order of the key/value pairs is arbitrary, and the names of the keys are
subject to extension and/or change. In order to manage any changes, and make it
future-safe, a version specification in the first line is a requirement. This
would make it possible to read in the files after changes in the format/key
names easily later.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>An example of a fort.22.meta file is as follows:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p># Example fort.22 meta file
version:1
year:2008
storm:07
advisory:01
hostname:tezpur.hpc.lsu.edu
directory advisory:/work/jgflemin/072008/01
directory storm:/work/jgflemin/072008/01/nowcast
modified:y
variation veer:+40</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The shorthand mechanism for fort.22 metadata consists of a symbolic link to
the fort.22 file. The name of the link encodes the track variations according
to the following format:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>YYYYSSAA[c|m]_w[<tt>|-]PPo[</tt>|-]PPv[<tt>|-]PPPr[</tt>|-]PP</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>where
YYYY is the four digit year
SS is the number of that storm for that year
AA is the advisory number
c means consensus or m means modified
w[<tt>|-]PP is the 2 digit, positive or negative percent variation in max
wind speed
o[</tt>|-]PP is the 2 digit, positive or negative percent variation in over
land speed
v[<tt>|-]PPP is the 3 digit, positive or negative percent variation in veer
r[</tt>|-]PP is the 2 digit, positive or negative percent variation in rmax
(not supported by storm_track_gen.pl as of ASGS v1.2).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As a concrete example of the above format that provides the same track
information as the fort.22.meta file described above:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>20080701m_w+00o+00v+040r+00</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This symbolic link can be found by looking for a filename that follows this
format; there will not be another file in the directory whose name matches
this format.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_development_strategy">Development Strategy</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The ASGS development strategy consists of the maintenance of two separate
versions at any given time: the stable version and the development version. The
stable version only receives bug fixes, while the development version receives
bug fixes as well as new features.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>At some point, the development version becomes stable. At that time, a stable
branch is created from it, and then new features are added to the previosly
stable code, creating a new development version. At that time, the major
version number will be incremented, e.g., stable v48.xx will become the next
development version as v49.00.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The minor version number is changed each time there is a change
in the code and the modified code is committed back to the repository. Details
of the implementation of this strategy with Subversion are provided in
the section entitled "Subversion".</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_pioneering">Pioneering</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>How to put the ASGS on a machine where it has never run before.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_subversion">Subversion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Subversion is a version control system. That is, it provides a means for many
software developers to collaborate on a single software project.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A subversion repository is a storehouse of code for a particular project.
Subversion repositories consist of a trunk, which is the mainline code that
everyone shares, and any number of branches that are created by and for
individual users.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A branch may be created by a developer that has a lot of changes to make over a
longer period of time. This lone developer can work on a branch without
affecting the mainline code. Once the changes in the branch are satisfactory,
the branch can be merged back to the trunk, making the changes available to
all.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A further advantage of Subversion is that it automates the process of merging
new features into ASGS. For example, in the past, without Subversion,
developers modified their local copies of ASGS and wanted to merge the
modifications into the mainline code. This required hours or days of
painstakingly examining each change they had made and cutting and pasting the
changes one by one into the up-to-date version of ASGS. With Subversion, the
software examines the changes that were made locally and makes corresponding
changes to the mainline version in an automated way.</p></div>
<h3 id="_policies">Policies</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Working with subversion requires greater coordination among ASGS developers.
For example, if two developers change the same line of code in two different
branches in two different ways, this will create a conflict that will have to
be resolved manually.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Furthermore, if one developer makes changes to trunk that prevent the code from
compiling, it will be difficult for other developers to continue working if
they update to the latest code. As a result, ASGS development with Subversion
will adhere to the following policies:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Communicate. Jason Fleming is responsible for making sure ASGS development is
smooth, pain-free and productive---when in doubt, email him (<a href="mailto:jason.fleming@seahorsecoastal.com">jason.fleming@seahorsecoastal.com</a>).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Make a branch to develop new features, rather than making changes to trunk.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Don&#8217;t commit changes to trunk that prevent the code from compiling, at least on your platform. You should also confirm that your code compiles with and without NetCDF.

the code, if necessary. The first thing to do in this case is usually to look
at the svn log to see what changes were made, so that you can select the right
version of the repository to extract. Go to the subdirectory of the code tree
that you want an older version of and issue the command</p></div>
