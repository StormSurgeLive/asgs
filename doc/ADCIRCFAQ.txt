Introduction
------------

*Q: What is ADCIRC and what can it do?*

*A* ADCIRC is a system of computer programs for solving time 
dependent, free surface circulation and transport problems in two 
and three dimensions. These programs utilize the finite element 
method in space and therefore can be run on highly flexible, 
irregularly spaced grids. Typical ADCIRC applications have included: 
modeling tidally and wind driven circulation in coastal waters, 
forecasting hurricane storm surge and flooding, dredging feasibility 
and material disposal studies, larval transport studies, riverine 
modeling for currents and water levels, and baroclinic coastal 
modeling from lab scale to field scale. 

*Q: What platforms does ADCIRC run on?*

*A:* ADCIRC runs on any operating system for which there is a 
working FORTRAN compiler. These include large commercial Unix 
systems (IBM Power & Blue Gene), Cray, SGI, Sun), Linux and FreeBSD 
based clusters, and personal workstations running Windows or Mac 
OSX. We are not aware of any platforms that support a working modern 
Fortran compiler that does not support ADCIRC. We routinely use the 
Intel, PGI, Intel, and GCC suites of compilers on a great variety of 
architectures. Network topology (Infiniband, GigE, shared memory 
MPI, etc) appropriate MPI libraries and C compilers are required in 
parallel environments. NetCDF libraries are optionally required in 
order to support this type of output. The coupled ADCIRC+SWAN model 
is available on all of the above platforms with the exception of 
Windows (as of March 2014). The coupled ADCIRC+STWAVE model is 
available on all the platforms including Windows PCs as part of the
Coastal Storm Modeling System (CSTORM-MS).

*Q: What are its main features?*

*A:*  

* Use of Cartesian or spherical coordinates
* Two dimensional depth integrated (2DDI) and 3D solution capabilities
* Full wetting/drying elements (2D and 3D)
* Barrier elements (e.g. levees)
* Conduits and porous barriers
* Harmonic analysis ("on the fly")
* Cold or hot starts
* Well documented with web-served user's manual
* Model design criteria
* Large domain - localized resolution strategy to simplify often very difficult boundary condition specification
* Very low numerical damping model allows model parameters to be based on physically relevant values
* Consistent with the governing equations
* Runs on single processor computers and parallel computers using MPI
* Ascii and NetCDF output formats

*Q: How can I engage with other ADCIRC users to ask questions and be
in touch with the latest developments?*

*A:* Contact Crystal Fulcher (cfulcher@email.unc.edu) and ask her to
subscribe you to the ADCIRC listserv (adcirc@listserv.unc.edu).

*Q: How can I purchase ADCIRC for Windows?*

*A:* ADCIRC is commerically available from Aquaveo, LLC (www.aquaveo.com) 
bundled with their software package SMS (Surface water Modeling 
System). SMS and ADCIRC are also available from Veri-Tech, Inc 
(www.veritechinc.com).

*Q: I am a commercial user. How can I legally access the copyrighted 
ADCIRC source code?*

*A:* Contact Crystal Fulcher (cfulcher@email.unc.edu).

*Q: What does ADCIRC need as input?*

*A:* A set of files which defines such things as: bathymetry, 
topography, boundary information, tidal characteristics, nodal 
attributes (often based on land use data), river inflow, 
meteorological forcing input, wave radiation stress forcing, and others
depending on the geographical area of interest.

*Q: What software packages are available for developing ADCIRC input 
(meshes in particular)?*

*A:* The tool of choice in the ADCIRC Community is the Surface water 
Modeling System (SMS) from Aquaveo, LLC. However, there are other 
possibilities, including the Blue Kenue package (https://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/solutions/advisory/blue_kenue_index.html).

*Q: What does ADCIRC create as output?*

*A:* Output files containing time varying and spatially varying 
water surface elevation, water velocity, wind velocity, and 
atmospheric pressure. These will be 2D or 3D as specified in the 
input.

*Q: How do I try it out?*

*A:* There are test problems that can be downloaded from the 
adcirc.org home page. Currently, there is no trial version of ADCIRC 
for download. It may be possible to obtain a trial version as part 
of the SMS software package (http://www.aquaveo.com/sms) which is 
commonly used for ADCIRC mesh development and editing as well as 
model output visualization.

*Q: Are there any restrictions on ADCIRC use?*

*A:* ADCIRC code cannot be redistributed. ADCIRC code is made freely 
available to academic, government, and other not-for-profit research 
purposes. Commercial use of ADCIRC is possible, but terms of use 
must be fully negotiated with the major software authors. If any 
results from ADCIRC, either direct or indirect, become published, 
the ADCIRC model should be acknowledged in print as well.

*Q: How do I visualize the results?*

*A:* ADCIRC output files are directly readable by the Surface water 
Modeling System (SMS) software package from Aquaveo 
(http://www.aquaveo.com). In addition, various users have developed 
utilities or scripts for visualizing ADCIRC output in ArcGIS, 
Tecplot, Paraview, Google Earth, and gnuplot. One of the most 
popular is a tool called FigureGen, which uses the Generic Mapping 
Tools (GMT) package to generate publication-quality figures and 
animations. It is developed by Casey Dietrich and is freely 
available from http://www.caseydietrich.com. For any of the other 
formats, you can request the latest version of an associated 
conversion utility from the ADCIRC mailing list. 

*Q: Who wrote ADCIRC?*

*A:* ADCIRC has been developed by Dr. Rick Luettich at the 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Institute of Marine 
Sciences and by Dr. Joannes Westerink at the University of Notre 
Dame, Department of Civil Engineering and Geologic Sciences.

*Q: Has ADCIRC been validated?*

*A:* The ADCIRC developers focused on proving that they are 
correctly solving the governing partial differential equations 
without introducing artificial damping or artificial modes that 
alter the stated physics. They proved consistency and convergence 
rates by examining problems with a range of dynamic balances so that 
their analytical tests mimic real world applications. They based 
error estimates on comparisons to simplified problems with 
analytical solutions or on Richardson extrapolation.

They used their models to solve real world problems applying 
observed geometry and boundary conditions, universal air-sea 
momentum transfer coefficients and frictional dissipation 
parameters, ideally based on small scale process specific 
measurements, so that a thorough evaluation of the model's 
performance could be made. They computed model to measurement error 
estimates and when possible measurement error estimates to define 
model errors.

Interested readers are referred to the substantial publication list 
at the ADCIRC homepage.

*Q: What if I find a bug in the code?*

*A:* There is a list serve (adcirc@listserv.unc.edu) where bugs can 
be reported. The primary contributors (Joannes Westerink and Rick 
Luettich) welcome bug reports.

*Q: How can I contribute to the development of ADCIRC?*

*A:* The list serve (adcirc@listserv.unc.edu) is good place to start 
connecting with people who are currently active within the 
development community. There is an ADCIRC community workshop each 
year which is open to anyone. More information can be found on the 
list serve.


*Q: I'm getting a "divide-by-zero" error when ADCIRC calls the SWAN 
coupler during parallel execution. What does this mean?*

*A:* This is an issue with the presence, location, and subdomain 
preparation status of the coupled SWAN input file (fort.26). Make 
sure that the swan input file fort.26 is in the same directory with 
the other fulldomain input files and has been distributed to the 
subdomain directories by adcprep.

*Q: How do I resolve the error message "too many files open" when running 
adcprep for large numbers of subdomains in parallel?*

*A:* Most operating systems (OS) set limits on the number of 
concurrently open files. If the number of subdomains is large 
(>1000), then the operating system may run out of available file 
handles when running adcprep. Find out how to increase the open file 
limit.  In Linux, this is something like "ulimit -n 8192", which 
tells the OS that, for this shell session, allow up to 8192 open 
files.  

*Q: When running ADCIRC, there are messages printed to the screen that
say 'WARNING: Elevation.gt.WarnElev' ... what does that mean?*

*A:* This means that the water surface elevation solution is farther 
above the geoid than the 'warning' threshold level.

Typically, this means that the water surface elevation solution is 
growing larger than expected which often indicates a growing 
instability. So why not just halt execution when this sort of 
solution begins to form? Well, due to very large tidal ranges in 
certain parts of the world, very high water elevations (e.g. 10 
meters) are *possible*, and therefore ADCIRC will merely log a 
warning at this point---not shut down the run. 

There is also an 'error' water level (e.g. 1000 meters) at which the solution
is clearly erroneous, causing ADCIRC to halt execution. The details of this
warning/error check behavior depend on certain hard coded threshold levels. The
default values for warning/error are:

WarnElev  = 20.0 meters
ErrorElev = 1000.0 meters.

*Q: I have made an ADCIRC mesh for my area of interest, but the 
resulting ADCIRC simulation is unstable, even with a very small time 
step. What should I do?*

*A:* Here are some places to start:

* Can you compute the CFL parameter for each of your elements and 
ensure that it is less that 1 globally?

* Can you compute the element quality (a measure of how 
'equilateral' the element is) for each element? Low quality elements 
(even just one or two) can give you problems.

* Try running a test simulation with the nonlinearity / 
wetting-drying features turned off and then bring them back in 
(presuming you get a stable run) one at a time.

* You may be able to get a more stable run by adjusting tau0 (the 
weighting between the primitive equation and the wave equation in 
the overall continuity equation). For detailed information on how to do 
this, please see the documentation of tau0 (in the fort.15 file) in 
the Official ADCIRC Users Manual at http://www.adcirc.org.

*Q: I have received an error like "forrtl: severe (''x''): attempt to ''blah
blah blah''" where ''x'' is a number and ''blah blah blah'' is some sort of
error message. What does this mean?*

*A:* This message was not produced by ADCIRC. It was produced by the 
library that comes with the Intel Fortran Compiler. For more 
detailed descriptions of the meaning of all these sorts of messages, 
please refer to the 
http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/UserInfo/Resources/Software/Intel/Compile
rs/8.1/f_ug1/ug1l_rt_errors.htm Run-Time Error Messages site.

*Q: What utilities are available for working with ADCIRC input and 
output?*

*A:* There are utilities available on the ADCIRC webpage at 
http://adcirc.org/Utility_programs.html. There are also many 
utilities that have been developed by various members of the ADCIRC 
community for their personal use. Please submit a question to the 
ADCIRC mailing list to find out what may already be available.

*Q: Can the passive scalar transport in ADCIRC be used? The user 
manual lists this option as “not fully implemented.” What, exactly, 
does this mean? Will it not give reliable results?*  

*A:* (Jason Fleming): Passive scalar transport is not the preferred 
approach to doing tracking studies of conserved quantities in the 
production version of ADCIRC. Instead, ADCIRC users generally take 
current velocity output data and run it through a separate code that 
they have written to advect clouds of virtual drifters. 

This approach is used because the production version of ADCIRC uses 
the Continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element formulation which 
guarantees mass conservation along the boundary, but not 
element-by-element mass conservation. Therefore, it is possible to 
have mass conservation errors when tracking a conserved scalar in CG 
ADCIRC. 

There is also a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation, called 
DGSWEM, which does guarantee element-by-element mass conservation. 
This code is available from the Institute for Computation 
Engineering and Sciences (ICES) at the University of Texas at Austin. 

(David Hill): We have written some scripts (matlab) to do this.  
They use a 4th order Runge-Kutta scheme to integrate the velocity 
fields and compute trajectories.  We have wondered, however, about 
the appropriate (output) time interval in the fort.64 file.  We have 
erred on the side of accuracy (we have very complicated domains) and 
use output every 5 or 10 minutes.  For large domain simulations, if 
one wants to track particles over several days / weeks...we are 
talking about a huge file.  Then, each time you wish to place and 
track particles, the integration process is very slow.  With much 
larger time intervals, however, too many particles seem to drift out 
of the domain. I have had, on my wish list (listen up, 
programmers!), a way in Adcirc to (some fort input file) to, at the 
start of a simulation, specify initial drifter locations and 'on' 
and 'off' times.  Then, when the simulation is run, Adcirc would, on 
the fly, compute the trajectories and store the output in an output 
file.  With the DG version of the code, will something like this be 
implemented in the future?

(John David Howlett): The model PTM may be of interest to you. An 
interface for PTM has been developed in SMS. PTM uses the 
hydrodynamic output from ADCIRC (and other models).

http://xmswiki.com/wiki/SMS:PTM

The Particle Tracking Model (PTM) is a Lagrangian particle tracker 
designed to allow the user to simulate particle transport processes. 
PTM is funded through two US Army Corps of Engineers Engineering 
Research and Development Center (ERDC) research programs, the 
Coastal Inlets Research Program (CIRP) and the Dredging Operations 
and Environmental Research (DOER) Program.

PTM has been developed for application to dredging and coastal 
projects including dredged material dispersion and fate, sediment 
pathway and fate, and constituent transport. The model contains 
algorithms that appropriately represent transport, settling, 
deposition, mixing, and resuspension processes in nearshore 
wave/current conditions. It uses waves and currents developed 
through other models and input directly to PTM as forcing functions.

(Nate Dill): Check out chapter 3 and the associated appendix

http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-06142007-084318/

Maybe too slow for a big ADCIRC grid, but it uses Scilab which is 
free so you don't need $$$ for SMS or Matlab. Was working on a much 
faster fortran version but not quite finished yet, email me if 
interested.

*Q: What does 'Failed to find prefix directory' mean? I got this 
error message while attempting to run ADCIRC in parallel.* 

*A*: The prefix directories are the PE000* directories that contain 
the subdomains for running in parallel. This error message is 
produced when PADCIRC is unable to find these subdomain directories. 
Possible causes include: 

* starting the job in a directory that does not contain the PE000* 
directories
* failing to preprocess (i.e., run adcprep) before starting the 
parallel run 
* failure of the underlying file system to provide access to the 
files. 

*Q: What is tau0?*

*A:* The tau0 parameter is multiplied by the primitive continuity 
equation; ADCIRC uses the both the primitive continuity equation as 
well as the wave continuity equation in an overall formulation 
called the Generalized Wave Continuity Equation. The tau0 parameter 
can be thought of as a "weight" for the primitive continuity 
equation. This weighting value is used to balance the numerical 
properties of the continuity equations. A higher value is generally 
used in shallower water. See the fort.15 documentation on 
adcirc.org, and feel free to consult the ADCIRC mailing list for 
recommendations for your particular modeling scenario.  

*Q: Is there a list of web-based resources where I can find out more about 
ADCIRC and ADCIRC+SWAN?*

*A: Yes. Here is a partial list of links:

* Official adcirc.org website and documentation: http://www.adcirc.org
