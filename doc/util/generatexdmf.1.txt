NAME
----
generateXDMF.f90 - Create a companion XDMF xml for an ADCIRC netcdf 
output file.  

SYNOPSIS
--------
*generateXDMF.x* [--use-cpp] --datafile 'ADCIRC_FILE_NAME'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The +generateXDMF.f90(1)+ program constructs a small Extensible Data Model
and Format (XDMF) xml companion file for the specified ADCIRC netcdf file. The 
XDMF format is an Army research standard file type. It is readable by several
different 3rd party applications, including ParaView, the free 3D 
multiplatform visualization application for scientific data.
The extension on the resulting xml file is '.xmf'.
 Since the XDMF
format requires data files that are formatted using the Hierarchical Data
Format (HDF5), which is also the underlying format for netcdf4, only ADCIRC
netcdf files that are formatted as netcdf4 are compatible with this program.


OPTIONS
-------

*--use-cpp*::
   Make the resulting xml file refer to the CPP projected coordinates in the
   netcdf file, instead of the geographic coordinates. 

*--datafile* 'ADCIRC_FILE_NAME'::
    Use the netcdf formatted ADCIRC output file named 'ADCIRC_FILE_NAME' when
    calcuating and writing the XDMF output. The *generateXDMF* program 
    works with the following ADCIRC output files: 'fort.63.nc', 'fort.64.nc',
    'fort.73.nc', 'fort.74.nc', 'maxele.63.nc', 'maxwvel.63.nc', 'rads.64.nc',
    'swan_DIR.63.nc', 'swan_HS.63.nc', 'swan_TMM10.63.nc', 'swan_TM01.63.nc',
    'swan_TM02.63.nc', and 'swan_TPS.63.nc'.
