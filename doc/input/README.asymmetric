time (ADCIRC time=0) if the simulation is cold started, or to the hot start
time if the simulation is hotstarted. 

README.asymmetric (NWS=9 in fort.15)

The asymmetric vortex wind model input differs from most other types of wind
input in ADCIRC in that it consists of storm parameters, rather than the
meteorological data itself. ADCIRC then uses these parameters to generate the
actual meteorological data internally at each node at every time step during
the simulation. The result is that the fort.22 files are very small (e.g.
20kB), in comparison with fort.22 files that contain actual meteorological
data. Furthermore, preprocessing these files is very fast because it consists
only of copying the fort.22 file as-is to each subdomain directory.

The format of the fort.22 file for the asymmetric wind model is the ATCF
(a.k.a. "BEST track") format. This format was developed by the U.S. Navy, and
ATCF stands for Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast. Historical tracks,
real-time hindcast tracks and real-time forecast tracks may be found in this
format. The format is documented in detail at the following web site:

http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/atcf_web/docs/database/new/abrdeck.html

One important thing to remember about this format is that it looks like CSV
data, but it is actually fixed column width data. Never change the width of the
columns when you edit this data!

It is assumed by the asymmetric wind code within ADCIRC that the first entry in
the fort.22 file corresponds to the cold start time (ADCIRC time=0) if the
simulation is cold started, or to the hotstart time if the simulation is
hotstarted. Therefore, the forecast period (column #6) needs to be edited by
the workflow scripts to reflect the time of the forecast/nowcast for each track
location (each line) in hours from the start of the simulation (0, 6, 12, 18,
etc). The original data in that column depends on what type of best track
format data is being used. The original data might have 0 or other numbers in
that column.

For more details on how to prepare the input files for the asymmetric wind
model, see the documentation in the ADCIRC manual under NWS=9:

http://adcirc.org/documentv48/parameter_defs.html#NWS

Real time hindcast and forecast advisories are made available by the NHC in
ATCF format via their ftp site every six hours when there is an active tropical
cyclone. These files are downloaded by the workflow and used to generate
fort.22 files for ADCIRC.

Since NHC forecast advisories do not contain the radius of maximum winds, this
option uses the standard radii at specific wind speeds (34, 50, 64, 100 knots)
reported in the four quadrants (NE, SE, SW, NW) of the storm to calculate the
radius of maximum winds as a function of the azimuthal angle.

The asymmetric wind model is activated by setting NWS=9 in the fort.15 file and
adding a WTIMINC line in the appropriate place in this file. The WTIMINC line
is not used, but is maintained for file-format compatilbility with the
symmetric vortex wind model, and for possible future expansion.

The asymmetric vortex wind model was developed and coded by Craig Mattocks
(cmattock@email.unc.edu) and implemented in ADCIRC by Cristina Forbes
(cforbes@email.unc.edu).
