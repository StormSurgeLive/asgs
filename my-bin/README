Adding "commands" to asgsh:

1. create a script in $SCRIPTDIR/bin
2. make script executable (recommended, `chmod 700`)

If you wish to add your script to the main ASGS distribution,
please follow the procedure noted in the CONTRIBUTING folder.

When in doubt, ask! We want to make it easy to make your own
scripts available inside of asgsh. If your script/tools are
generally useful, then we want to make it easy to get them
added to the official distribution.

A Note on Dependencies:

It is preferred that scripts contained have no dependencies
outside of what is provided in the default asgsh environment/
ASGS installation. The idea is that they are provided "as-is"
and work using the latest installed ASGS environment.

* shell scripts are preferred (without the ".sh" extension)
* Perl scripts are fine as long as they do not require additional
  modules to be installed; if this is required PLEASE ASK about
  the best approach. The official Perl module list is contained in
  ./PERL-MODULES file; these are installed automatically when ASGS
  is installed or deeply updated ('update-asgsh " "')
* Python scripts are fine as long as they do not require additional
  modules or dependencies; this is a little more tedious to manage
  than the Perl environment. We're also using a "deprecated" version
  of Python (2.7.18 at the time of this writing); so further complications
  will ensue if Python 3 is required.
* anything that needs to be compiled to work is discouraged from being
  made available via ./my-bin or ./bin; PLEASE ASK if you wish to add
  support for building a compiled tool to the ASGS installation or 
  deep update; it is as part of asgs-brew.pl that compiled tools
  and libraries are meant to be "officially" supported

The asgsh Environment:

To see what the asgsh environment contains, start up asgsh,
then issue the command:

  asgs (default)>env | grep ASGS
